In particular, we consider the scenario where a network of actuators cooperates in order to recover from actuator faults. Such recovery is performed through a reconfiguration which minimizes the performance loss due to actuator faults, while guaranteing that the same state trajectory is obtained. The design of the distributed reconfiguration scheme is proposed and evaluated in numerical examples.},

An attack space defined by the adversary’s model knowledge, disclosure, and disruption resources is introduced. Adversaries constrained by these resources are modeled for a networked control system architecture. It is shown that attack scenarios corresponding to denial-of-service, replay, zero-dynamics, and bias injection attacks on linear time-invariant systems can be analyzed using this framework. Furthermore, the attack policy for each scenario is described and the attack’s impact is characterized using the concept of safe sets. An experimental setup based on a quadruple-tank process controlled over a wireless network is used to illustrate the attack scenarios, their consequences, and potential counter-measures.},

	abstract = {The Cheeger inequality for undirected graphs, which relates the conductance of an undirected graph and the second smallest eigenvalue of its normalized Laplacian, is a cornerstone of spectral graph theory. The Cheeger inequality has been extended to directed graphs and hypergraphs using normalized Laplacians for those, that are no longer linear but piecewise linear transformations. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a submodular transformation \$F:{\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}m\$, which applies \$m\$ submodular functions to the \$n\$-dimensional input vector, and then introduce the notions of its Laplacian and normalized Laplacian. With these notions, we unify and generalize the existing Cheeger inequalities by showing a Cheeger inequality for submodular transformations, which relates the conductance of a submodular transformation and the smallest non-trivial eigenvalue of its normalized Laplacian. This result recovers the Cheeger inequalities for undirected graphs, directed graphs, and hypergraphs, and derives novel Cheeger inequalities for mutual information and directed information. Computing the smallest non-trivial eigenvalue of a normalized Laplacian of a submodular transformation is NP-hard under the small set expansion hypothesis. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time \$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$-approximation algorithm for the symmetric case, which is tight, and a polynomial-time \$O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2n+{\textbackslash}log n {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}log m)\$-approximation algorithm for the general case. We expect the algebra concerned with submodular transformations, or {\textbackslash}emph\{submodular algebra\}, to be useful in the future not only for generalizing spectral graph theory but also for analyzing other problems that involve piecewise linear transformations, e.g., deep learning.},

Depending on the occurrences of disturbance and/or faults on positive systems, the authors use two types of observer structures and provide design strategies for reliable estimation of states, disturbance, and faults. Although various positive observers have been designed for positive systems, they fail to estimate the states in presence of unknown inputs. To realise simultaneous estimation of states and unknown inputs for positive systems, a special type of unknown input observer (UIO) called positive UIO (PUIO) is introduced and an linear matrix inequality (LMI) based approach is provided to make its design possible. The authors also show that simultaneous states and sensor fault estimation can be solved by a conversion scheme through a positive filtering process of the output. This allows to convert the sensor fault as an unknown input and employ the PUIO design. Finally, the problem of robust fault detection for positive systems is formulated and solved by combining the capability of UIO with proportional–integral (PI) observer. This integrated observer (PIUIO) decouples the unknown input disturbance through its UIO part while allowing PI part to estimate the fault. Several examples are constructed to support the theoretical results.},

However, such algorithms have many limitations that arise from the use of random walks, e.g., the features resulting from these methods are unable to transfer to new nodes and graphs as they are tied to vertex identity. In this work, we introduce the Role2Vec framework which uses the flexible notion of attributed random walks, and serves as a basis for generalizing existing methods such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and many others that leverage random walks. Our proposed framework enables these methods to be more widely applicable for both transductive and inductive learning as well as for use on graphs with attributes (if available). This is achieved by learning functions that generalize to new nodes and graphs. We show that our proposed framework is effective with an average AUC improvement of 16:55\% while requiring on average 853x less space than existing methods on a variety of graphs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a general graph representation learning framework called DeepGL for learning deep node and edge representations from large (attributed) graphs. In particular, DeepGL begins by deriving a set of base features (e.g., graphlet features) and automatically learns a multi-layered hierarchical graph representation where each successive layer leverages the output from the previous layer to learn features of a higher-order. Contrary to previous work, DeepGL learns relational functions (each representing a feature) that generalize across-networks and therefore useful for graph-based transfer learning tasks. Moreover, DeepGL naturally supports attributed graphs, learns interpretable features, and is space-efficient (by learning sparse feature vectors). In addition, DeepGL is expressive, flexible with many interchangeable components, efficient with a time complexity of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbar}E{\textbar})\$, and scalable for large networks via an efficient parallel implementation. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, DeepGL is (1) effective for across-network transfer learning tasks and attributed graph representation learning, (2) space-efficient requiring up to 6x less memory, (3) fast with up to 182x speedup in runtime performance, and (4) accurate with an average improvement of 20\% or more on many learning tasks.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a distributed coordination scheme with local information exchange for multiple vehicle systems. We introduce second-order consensus protocols that take into account motions of the information states and their derivatives, extending first-order protocols from the literature. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which consensus can be reached in the context of unidirectional information exchange topologies. This work takes into account the general case where information flow may be unidirectional due to sensors with limited fields of view or vehicles with directed, power-constrained communication links. Unlike the first-order case, we show that having a (directed) spanning tree is a necessary rather than a sufficient condition for consensus seeking with second-order dynamics. This work focuses on a formal analysis of information exchange topologies that permit second-order consensus. Given its importance to the stability of the coordinated system, an analysis of the consensus term control gains is also presented, specifically the strength of the information states relative to their derivatives. As an illustrative example, consensus protocols are applied to coordinate the movements of multiple mobile robots. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper, a new approximate method based on nonnegative matrix factorization with sparse constraints is presented. Firstly, the graph matching is formulated as an optimization problem with nonnegative and sparse constraints, followed by an efficient algorithm to solve this constrained problem. Then, we show the strong relationship between the sparsity of the relaxation solution and its effectiveness for graph matching based on our model. A key benefit of our method is that the solution is sparse and thus can approximately impose the one-to-one mapping constraints in the optimization process naturally. Therefore, our method can approximate the original IQP problem more closely than other approximate methods. Extensive and comparative experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph matching method.},

Unlike conventional approaches, our zero-shot retrievalmethod does not require knowledge of the activity classes contained in the video. We propose a novel user-centric approach thatmodels queries through the creation of sparse semantic graphs based on attributes and discriminative relationships. We then pose search as a ranked subgraph matching problem and leverage the fact that the attributes and relationships in the query have different levels of discriminability to filter out bad matches. Rather than solving the NP-hard exact subgraph matching problem, we develop a novel maximally discriminative spanning tree (MDST) as the relaxation of a given query graph, and then describe a matching algorithm that recovers matches to this tree in linear time using maximally discriminative subgraphmatching (MDSM).We utilize theMDST tominimize the number of possible matches to the original query while guaranteeing that the best matches are within this set. We test this algorithm on two large video datasets: the 35-GB Virat Ground dataset and a 1-TB aerial data collection from Yuma. These datasets yield graphs with 200,000 nodes and 1 million nodes, respectively, with an average degree of 5. Our approach finds complex, large-scale queries in seconds while maintaining comparable precision and recall to slower current approaches.},

Since graph energy is the trace norm of the adjacency matrix, matrix norms provide a natural background for its study. Thus, this paper surveys research on matrix norms that aims to expand and advance the study of graph energy. The focus is exclusively on the Ky Fan and the Schatten norms, both generalizing and enriching the trace norm. As it turns out, the study of extremal properties of these norms leads to numerous analytic problems with deep roots in combinatorics. The survey brings to the fore the exceptional role of Hadamard matrices, conference matrices, and conference graphs in matrix norms. In addition, a vast new matrix class is studied, a relaxation of symmetric Hadamard matrices. The survey presents solutions to just a fraction of a larger body of similar problems bonding analysis to combinatorics. Thus, open problems and questions are raised to outline topics for further investigation.},

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide \$F\_1\$ scores up to 10\% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60\% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {This thesis investigates both how computational perspectives can improve our understanding of social networks, and also how modern insights about social networks can be put to work to address difficult computational and inferential challenges across systems engineering and the social sciences. The microstructure of human behavior has a rich history of study across many disciplines, and only recently—through the data deluge of online instrumentation and experimentation—has the role networks play across social and economic domains come into full view. Work in this thesis examines how social network neighborhoods, the rich local networks that surround individuals, function as contact surfaces through which individuals process information, mediating social decision and social contagion processes. Work in this thesis on distributing graph computations at Facebook, the online social networking service, has led to dramatic efficiency gains there, successfully deploying a new partitioning algorithm to reduce average query times for their “People You May Know” link prediction system by 50\%. These improvements were achieved by harnessing both geographic and network structures of social graphs not necessarily found in other graph contexts. Additional work presents a highly scalable “restreaming” approach to partitioning massive graphs with rich local structure. Lastly, work on interference in online experiments (A/B tests) offers a framework based on graph partitioning to design lower variance estimators for treatment effects under network interference, a grand challenge of modern online experimentation. As individuals bring their social relations online, the web is rapidly evolving from a network of documents to a network of people, and computing with social data will require richer, novel methods for working with the subtleties that give social networks their distinctive character.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of models for networks raises challenging problems of model selection: the data are sparse and globally dependent, and models are typically high-dimensional and have large numbers of latent variables. Together, these issues mean that the usual model-selection criteria do not work properly for networks. We illustrate these challenges, and show one way to resolve them, by considering the key network-analysis problem of dividing a graph into communities or blocks of nodes with homogeneous patterns of links to the rest of the network. The standard tool for undertaking this is the stochastic block model, under which the probability of a link between two nodes is a function solely of the blocks to which they belong. This imposes a homogeneous degree distribution within each block; this can be unrealistic, so degree-corrected block models add a parameter for each node, modulating its overall degree. The choice between ordinary and degree-corrected block models matters because they make very different inferences about communities. We present the first principled and tractable approach to model selection between standard and degree-corrected block models, based on new large-graph asymptotics for the distribution of log-likelihood ratios under the stochastic block model, finding substantial departures from classical results for sparse graphs. We also develop linear-time approximations for log-likelihoods under both the stochastic block model and the degree-corrected model, using belief propagation. Applications to simulated and real networks show excellent agreement with our approximations. Our results thus both solve the practical problem of deciding on degree correction and point to a general approach to model selection in network analysis.},

Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge features we observe—more informative edge features are more expensive, and hence the number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of the edge features. We studied this problem by formulating a quantity/quality trade-off for a simple class of random graphs model, namely, the stochastic blockmodel. We then consider a simple but optimal vertex classifier for classifying v and we derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off. The optimal operating points for the quantity/quality trade-off are surprising and illustrate the issue that methods for intermediate tasks should be chosen to maximize performance for the ultimate inference task. Finally, we investigate the quantity/quality tradeoff for errorful observations of the C. elegans connectome graph.},

Good predictions enable us to improve advice to users, and obtain a better understanding of the socio-psychological processes that determine those preferences. We have developed a collaborative filtering model, with an associated scalable algorithm, that makes accurate predictions of individuals' preferences. Our approach is based on the explicit assumption that there are groups of individuals and of items, and that the preferences of an individual for an item are determined only by their group memberships. Importantly, we allow each individual and each item to belong simultaneously to mixtures of different groups and, unlike many popular approaches, such as matrix factorization, we do not assume implicitly or explicitly that individuals in each group prefer items in a single group of items. The resulting overlapping groups and the predicted preferences can be inferred with a expectation-maximization algorithm whose running time scales linearly (per iteration). Our approach enables us to predict individual preferences in large datasets, and is considerably more accurate than the current algorithms for such large datasets.},

	abstract = {Applied network science often involves preprocessing network data before applying a network-analysis method, and there is typically a theoretical disconnect between these steps. For example, it is common to aggregate time-varying network data into windows prior to analysis, and the tradeoffs of this preprocessing are not well understood. Focusing on the problem of detecting small communities in multilayer networks, we study the effects of layer aggregation by developing random-matrix theory for modularity matrices associated with layer-aggregated networks with \$N\$ nodes and \$L\$ layers, which are drawn from an ensemble of Erd{\textbackslash}H\{o\}s-R{\textbackslash}'enyi networks. We study phase transitions in which eigenvectors localize onto communities (allowing their detection) and which occur for a given community provided its size surpasses a detectability limit \$K{\textasciicircum}*\$. When layers are aggregated via a summation, we obtain \$K{\textasciicircum}*{\textbackslash}varpropto {\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}sqrt\{NL\}/T)\$, where \$T\$ is the number of layers across which the community persists. Interestingly, if \$T\$ is allowed to vary with \$L\$ then summation-based layer aggregation enhances small-community detection even if the community persists across a vanishing fraction of layers, provided that \$T/L\$ decays more slowly than \$ {\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(L{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\})\$. Moreover, we find that thresholding the summation can in some cases cause \$K{\textasciicircum}*\$ to decay exponentially, decreasing by orders of magnitude in a phenomenon we call super-resolution community detection. That is, layer aggregation with thresholding is a nonlinear data filter enabling detection of communities that are otherwise too small to detect. Importantly, different thresholds generally enhance the detectability of communities having different properties, illustrating that community detection can be obscured if one analyzes network data using a single threshold.},

The resulting marginal distribution defines a posterior over the number of clusters and cluster memberships. Sampling from this posterior is simpler than from the original SBM as transdimensional MCMC can be avoided. The algorithm is based on the allocation sampler. It requires a prior to be placed on the number of clusters, thereby allowing the number of clusters to be directly estimated by the algorithm, rather than being given as an input parameter. Synthetic and real data are used to test the speed and accuracy of the model and algorithm, including the ability to estimate the number of clusters.

We prove that every graph has a spectral sparsifier of nearly linear size. Moreover, we present an algorithm that produces spectral sparsifiers in time O(m logc m), where m is the number of edges in the original graph and c is some absolute constant. This construction is a key component of a nearly linear time algorithm for solving linear equations in diagonally dominant matrices. Our sparsification algorithm makes use of a nearly linear time algorithm for graph partitioning that satisfies a strong guarantee: if the partition it outputs is very unbalanced, then the larger part is contained in a subgraph of high conductance.},

Both actuator and sensor faults are considered and the solution for each case is provided. Although positive observers have been designed for positive systems, they are unable to estimate the states when unknown inputs (disturbances or faults) are present in the systems. To realize simultaneous estimation of states and unknown inputs, we design a positive unknown input observer (PUIO) for positive linear systems. A critical step in the design process is the requirement of imposing a condition on positivity of the generalized inverse of a certain design matrix. The design can be performed with the aid of a positive stabilization procedure via LMI. We also show that the problem of simultaneous states and sensor faults estimations can be solved by a conversion scheme. By introducing an auxiliary positive system constructed from the output and its augmentation to the original positive system, we convert the sensor fault as an unknown input and employ the PUIO design to the augmented system. Finally, theoretical results are supported by numerical examples.},

We propose a linear deception attack strategy and present the corresponding feasibility constraint which guarantees that the attacker is able to successfully inject false data without being detected. The evolution of the estimation error covariance at the remote estimator is derived and the degradation of system performance under the proposed linear attack policy is analyzed. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form expression of the optimal attack strategy among all linear attacks.

To comply with the network setting, our work considers perturbations with a desired sparsity structure, thus extending the classic literature on the observability radius of linear systems. The paper proposes two sets of results. First, we propose an optimization framework to determine a perturbation with smallest Frobenius norm that renders a desired mode unobservable from the existing sensor nodes. Second, we study the expected observability radius of networks with given structure and random edge weights. We provide fundamental robustness bounds dependent on the connectivity properties of the network and we analytically characterize optimal perturbations of line and star networks, showing that line networks are inherently more robust than star networks.},

	abstract = {Abstract This work studies consensus strategies for networks of agents with limited memory, computation, and communication capabilities. We assume that agents can process only values from a finite alphabet, and we adopt the framework of finite fields, where the alphabet consists of the integers  0 , … , p − 1  , for some prime number p , and operations are performed modulo p . Thus, we define a new class of consensus dynamics, which can be exploited in certain applications such as pose estimation in capacity and memory constrained sensor networks. For consensus networks over finite fields, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the network topology and weights to ensure convergence. We show that consensus networks over finite fields converge in finite time, a feature that can be hardly achieved over the field of real numbers. For the design of finite-field consensus networks, we propose a general design method, with high computational complexity, and a network composition rule to generate large consensus networks from smaller components. Finally, we discuss the application of finite-field consensus networks to distributed averaging and pose estimation in sensor networks.},

We consider smart intruders, which appear at arbitrary times and locations, are aware of the cameras configuration, and move to avoid detection for as long as possible. As performance criteria, we consider the worst case detection time (WDT) and the average detection time (ADT). We focus on the case of a chain of cameras, and we obtain the following results. First, we characterize a lower bound on the WDT and on the ADT of smart intruders. Second, we propose a team trajectory for the cameras, namely equal-waiting trajectory, with minimum WDT and with guarantees on the ADT. Third, we design a distributed algorithm to coordinate the cameras along an equal-waiting trajectory. Fourth, we design a distributed algorithm for cameras reconfiguration in the case of failure or network change. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms via numerical studies and experiments.},

Current \{EMS\} state estimation algorithms have bad data detection (BDD) schemes to detect outliers in the measurement data, based on high measurement redundancy. Although these methods can detect a set of basic cyber attacks, they may fail in the presence of an intelligent attacker. We explore the latter by considering scenarios where stealthy deception attacks are performed by sending false information to the control center. We begin by presenting a recent framework that characterizes the attack as an optimization problem with the objective specified through a security metric and constraints corresponding to the attack cost. The framework is used to conduct realistic experiments on a state-of-the-art \{SCADA\} \{EMS\} software for a power network example with 14 substations, 27 buses, and 40 branches. To the authors best knowledge, this is the first such experimental study. The results indicate how state estimators for power networks can be made more resilient to cyber security attacks.},

In particular, we consider systems with redundant sensors and actuators cooperating to recover from faults. Reconfiguration is performed while minimizing a steady-state estimation error covariance and a quadratic control cost. A model-matching condition is imposed on the reconfiguration scheme. It is shown that the reconfiguration and its underlying computation can be distributed. Using an average dwell-time approach, the stability of the distributed reconfiguration scheme under finite-time termination is analyzed. The approach is illustrated in a numerical example.},

To the best of our knowledge, this task has not been addressed using these kind of architectures.

The definition of exactness abstracts an elementary property of fields and the tropical semiring, which we believe is fundamental to explaining this similarity. The class of exact semirings turns out to include many other important examples of both rings (proper quotients of principal ideal domains, matrix rings and finite group rings over these and over fields), and semirings (the Boolean semiring, generalisations of the tropical semiring, matrix semirings and group semirings over these).},

As a consequence, we have that a square matrix A over a Boolean ring R with identity 1 is invertible over R if and only if det+ A+detA = 1 where det+ A and detA are the positive determinant and the negative determinant of A, respectively. This result is generalized to Boolean semirings with identity. By a Boolean semiring we mean a commutative semiring S with zero in which x2 = x for all x 2 S. By making use of Reutenauer and Sraubing's work in 1984, we show that an n  n matrix A over a Boolean semiring S with identity 1 is invertible over S if and only if det+ A + detA = 1 and 2AijAik = 0 [2AjiAki = 0] for all i; j; k 2 f1; : : : ; ng such that j 6 = k.},

První část práce se zabývá škálovatelností metod Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Představuji nové algoritmy pro škálovatelnou tvorbu těchto sémantických modelů. Škálovatelnost je dosažena 1) distribucí výpočtů na více strojů a 2) využitím pouze konstatního množství paměti vzhledem k velikosti trénovacích dat, a 3) trénováním modelu v omezeném počtu průchodů trénovacími daty (resp. pouze na jeden průchod v případě LSA, což umožňuje trénování na nekonečném, nestacionárním proudu trénovacích dat). Druhá část práce popisuje několik možných aplikací těchto obecných sémantických algoritmů. Prezentuji zde výsledky svého výzkumu v oblasti Information Retrieval (IR), jako je např. tématická segmentace volného textu, sémantická podobnost dokumentů v digitálních knihovnách či efektivní segmentace textu podle jazyka.

Moreover, we showed that the L1 gain with the weighting vectors plays an essential role in stability analysis of interconnected positive systems. Aiming at extending this result for stabilization of interconnected positive systems, in this paper, we study L1-optimal feedback controller synthesis for positive systems with given weighing vectors. In particular, we will show that an L1-optimal state-feedback gain designed for a fixed positive system and a fixed pair of weighing vectors is robustly optimal against variations on the input matrix, the direct feedthrough matrix of the controlled positive system as well as variations on the weighting vector for the disturbance input signal. This property is of course promising for robust L1-optimal control of uncertain positive systems. We illustrate the robust optimality property by numerical examples.},

In order to overcome the under-determinacy of the problem at hand, we leverage concepts from spectral graph theory and convex optimization to unveil the underlying network structure. More precisely, we formulate the network inference problem as a convex optimization that seeks to endow the network with certain desired properties -- such as sparsity -- while being consistent with the spectral information extracted from the observed opinions. This is complemented with theoretical results proving consistency as the number \$M\$ of topics grows large. We further illustrate our method by numerical experiments, which showcase the effectiveness of the technique in recovering synthetic and real-world networks.},

	abstract = {The Gaussian process state space model (GPSSM) is a non-linear dynamical system, where unknown transition and/or measurement mappings are described by GPs. Most research in GPSSMs has focussed on the state estimation problem, i.e., computing a posterior of the latent state given the model. However, the key challenge in GPSSMs has not been satisfactorily addressed yet: system identification, i.e., learning the model. To address this challenge, we impose a structured Gaussian variational posterior distribution over the latent states, which is parameterised by a recognition model in the form of a bi-directional recurrent neural network. Inference with this structure allows us to recover a posterior smoothed over sequences of data. We provide a practical algorithm for efficiently computing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using the reparameterisation trick. This further allows for the use of arbitrary kernels within the GPSSM. We demonstrate that the learnt GPSSM can efficiently generate plausible future trajectories of the identified system after only observing a small number of episodes from the true system.},

	abstract = {The evolution dynamics of a software ecosystem depend on the activity of the developer community contributing to projects within it. Both social and technical changes affect an ecosystem's evolution and the research community has been investigating the impact of these modifications over the last few years. Existing studies mainly focus on temporary modifications, often ignoring the effect of permanent changes on the software ecosystem. We present an empirical study of the magnitude and effect of permanent modifications in both the social and technical parts of a software ecosystem. More precisely, we measure permanent changes with regard to the ecosystem's projects, contributors and source code files and present our findings concerning the effect of these modifications. We study the Ruby ecosystem in GitHub over a nine-year period by carrying out a socio-technical analysis of the co-evolution of a large number of base projects and their forks. This analysis involves both the source code developed for these projects as well as the developers having contributed to them. We discuss our findings with respect to the ecosystem evolution according to three different viewpoints: (1) the base projects, (2) the forks and (3) the entire ecosystem containing both the base projects and forks. Our findings show an increased growth in both the technical and social aspects of the Ruby ecosystem until early 2014, followed by an increased contributor and project abandonment rate. We show the effect of permanent modifications in the ecosystem evolution and provide preliminary evidence of contributors migrating to other ecosystems when leaving the Ruby ecosystem.},

To explore the openness of a software project, we propose three metrics focused on: (1) the distribution of the project community, (2) the rate of acceptance of external contributions and (3) the time it takes to become an official collaborator of the project. We have adapted and applied these metrics to a subset of GitHub projects, thus giving some practical findings on their openness.},

In many systems of practical importance, all the state variables are not available for measurements, although the entire state vector has to be known for control strategies for example. In this situation, one can construct an approximation of the full state vector based on available measurements. Such a device is known as an observer. In particular, this study determines structural conditions on positive linear systems for the existence of convergent positive linear observers. Single output systems are first considered.

	abstract = {Motivated by geometric problems in signal processing, computer vision, and structural biology, we study a class of orbit recovery problems where we observe noisy copies of an unknown signal, each acted upon by a random element of some group (such as \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}/p\$ or \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{SO\}(3)\$). The goal is to recover the orbit of the signal under the group action. This generalizes problems of interest such as multi-reference alignment (MRA) and the reconstruction problem in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We obtain matching lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of these problems in high generality, showing that the statistical difficulty is intricately determined by the invariant theory of the underlying symmetry group. In particular, we determine that for cryo-EM with noise variance \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2\$ and uniform viewing directions, the number of samples required scales as \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}6\$. We match this bound with a novel algorithm for ab initio reconstruction in cryo-EM, based on invariant features of degree at most \$3\$. We further discuss how to recover multiple molecular structures from heterogeneous cryo-EM samples.},

In the setting with the interaction topologies for the position and velocity information flows being modeled by different graphs, some sufficient conditions on the fixed interaction topologies are derived for the agents to reach consensus. In the setting with the interaction topologies for the position and velocity information flows being modeled by the same graph, we systematically investigate the consensus algorithm for the agents under both fixed and dynamically changing directed interaction topologies. Specifically, for the fixed case, a necessary and sufficient condition on the interaction topology is established for the agents to reach (average) consensus under certain assumptions. For the dynamically changing case, some sufficient conditions are obtained for the agents to reach consensus, where the condition imposed on the dynamical topologies is shown to be more relaxed than that required in the existing literature. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the theoretical findings through some numerical examples.},

This professional reference is divided into three main parts: The  first part contains the definitions and basic properties of  positive linear systems. The second part, following the theoretical  exposition, reports the main conceptual results, considering  applicable examples taken from a number of widely used models. The  third part is devoted to the study of some classes of positive  linear systems of particular relevance in applications (such as the  Leontief model, the Leslie model, the Markov chains, the  compartmental systems, and the queueing systems). Readers familiar  with linear algebra and linear systems theory will appreciate the  way arguments are treated and presented.    Extraordinarily comprehensive, Positive Linear Systems  features:  * Applications from a variety of backgrounds including modeling,  control engineering, computer science, demography, economics,  bioengineering, chemistry, and ecology  * References and annotated bibliographies throughout the book  * Two appendices concerning linear algebra and linear systems  theory for readers unfamiliar with the mathematics used      Farina and Rinaldi make no effort to hide their enthusiasm for the  topics presented, making Positive Linear Systems: Theory and  Applications an indispensable resource for researchers and  professionals in a broad range of fields.},

	abstract = {Role discovery in graphs is an emerging area that allows analysis of complex graphs in an intuitive way. In contrast to other graph prob- lems such as community discovery, which finds groups of highly connected nodes, the role discovery problem finds groups of nodes that share similar graph topological structure. However, existing work so far has two severe limitations that prevent its use in some domains. Firstly, it is completely unsupervised which is undesirable for a number of reasons. Secondly, most work is limited to a single relational graph. We address both these lim- itations in an intuitive and easy to implement alternating least squares framework. Our framework allows convex constraints to be placed on the role discovery problem which can provide useful supervision. In par- ticular we explore supervision to enforce i) sparsity, ii) diversity and iii) alternativeness. We then show how to lift this work for multi-relational graphs. A natural representation of a multi-relational graph is an order 3 tensor (rather than a matrix) and that a Tucker decomposition allows us to find complex interactions between collections of entities (E-groups) and the roles they play for a combination of relations (R-groups). Existing Tucker decomposition methods in tensor toolboxes are not suited for our purpose, so we create our own algorithm that we demonstrate is pragmatically useful.},

	abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a useful tool in a broad range of applications, from signal separation to computer vision and machine learning. NMF is a hard (NP-hard) computational problem for which various approximate solutions have been developed over the years. Given the widespread interest in NMF and its applications, it is perhaps surprising that the pertinent Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on the accuracy of the nonnegative latent factor estimates has not been worked out in the literature. In hindsight, one reason may be that the required computations are more subtle than usual: the problem involves constraints and ambiguities that must be dealt with, and the Fisher information matrix is always singular. We provide a concise tutorial derivation of the CRLB for both symmetric NMF and asymmetric NMF, using the latest CRLB tools, which should be of broad interest for analogous derivations in related factor analysis problems. We illustrate the behavior of these bounds with respect to model parameters and put some of the best NMF algorithms to the test against one another and the CRLB. The results help illuminate what can be expected from the current state of art in NMF algorithms, and they are reassuring in that the gap to optimality is small in relatively sparse and low rank scenarios.},

Also, if one of the graphs is anonymized, how can we use information in one to de-anonymize the other? The key step in all such graph mining tasks is to find effective node features. We propose ReFeX (Recursive Feature eXtraction), a novel algorithm, that recursively combines local (node-based) features with neighborhood (egonet-based) features; and outputs regional features -- capturing "behavioral" information. We demonstrate how these powerful regional features can be used in within-network and across-network classification and de-anonymization tasks -- without relying on homophily, or the availability of class labels. The contributions of our work are as follows: (a) ReFeX is scalable and (b) it is effective, capturing regional ("behavioral") information in large graphs. We report experiments on real graphs from various domains with over 1M edges, where ReFeX outperforms its competitors on typical graph mining tasks like network classification and de-anonymization.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3937},
	abstract = {A key task in social network and other complex network analysis is role analysis: describing and categorizing nodes according to how they interact with other nodes. Two nodes have the same role if they interact with equivalent sets of neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence. Unfortunately, the fastest algorithms known for graph automorphism are nonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence may be rare, a more meaningful task is to measure the role similarity between any two nodes. This task is closely related to the structural or link-based similarity problem that SimRank attempts to solve. However, SimRank and most of its offshoots are not sufficient because they do not fully recognize automorphically or structurally equivalent nodes. In this paper we tackle two problems. First, what are the necessary properties for a role similarity measure or metric? Second, how can we derive a role similarity measure satisfying these properties? For the first problem, we justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a role similarity measure or metric: range, maximal similarity, automorphic equivalence, transitive similarity, and the triangle inequality. For the second problem, we present RoleSim, a new similarity metric with a simple iterative computational method. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all the axiomatic properties. We also introduce an iceberg RoleSim algorithm which can guarantee to discover all pairs with RoleSim score no less than a user-defined threshold \${\textbackslash}theta\$ without computing the RoleSim for every pair. We demonstrate the superior interpretative power of RoleSim on both both synthetic and real datasets.},

In this article we propose the introduction of Sentiment Analysis techniques in order to identify and monitor the underlying sentiments in the text written by developers in issues and tickets. Therefore, in order to check its viability we conducted an exploratory case study analysing polarity and emotional clues in development issues from nine well-known projects that are freely available. Results show that although both polarity and emotional analysis are applicable, the emotional analysis looks to be more suitable to this kind of corpus. The developers leave underlying sentiments in the text, and that information could be monitored as any other feature in the development process.},

We present a comprehensive picture of the algorithmic complexity of the contraction problem for affine tolerance functions \${\textbackslash}varphi(x)=x/{\textbackslash}alpha-{\textbackslash}beta\$, where \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}geq 1\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}geq 0\$ are arbitrary real-valued parameters.

	abstract = {In the Steiner Forest problem, we are given a graph and a collection of source-sink pairs, and the goal is to find a subgraph of minimum total length such that all pairs are connected. The problem is APX-Hard and can be 2-approximated by, e.g., the elegant primal-dual algorithm of Agrawal, Klein, and Ravi from 1995. We give a local-search-based constant-factor approximation for the problem. Local search brings in new techniques to an area that has for long not seen any improvements and might be a step towards a combinatorial algorithm for the more general survivable network design problem. Moreover, local search was an essential tool to tackle the dynamic MST/Steiner Tree problem, whereas dynamic Steiner Forest is still wide open. It is easy to see that any constant factor local search algorithm requires steps that add/drop many edges together. We propose natural local moves which, at each step, either (a) add a shortest path in the current graph and then drop a bunch of inessential edges, or (b) add a set of edges to the current solution. This second type of moves is motivated by the potential function we use to measure progress, combining the cost of the solution with a penalty for each connected component. Our carefully-chosen local moves and potential function work in tandem to eliminate bad local minima that arise when using more traditional local moves.},

	abstract = {Homomorphic secret sharing (HSS) is the secret sharing analogue of homomorphic encryption. An HSS scheme supports a local evaluation of functions on shares of one or more secret inputs, such that the resulting shares of the output are short. Some applications require the stronger notion of additive HSS, where the shares of the output add up to the output over a finite Abelian group. While strong feasibility results for HSS are known under specific cryptographic assumptions, many natural questions remain open.



We initiate a systematic study of HSS, making the following contributions.

* A definitional framework. We present a general framework for defining HSS schemes that unifies and extends several previous notions from the literature, and cast known results within this framework.

* Limitations. We establish limitations on information-theoretic multi-input HSS with short output shares via a relation with communication complexity. We also show that additive HSS for non-trivial functions, even the AND of two input bits, implies non-interactive key exchange, and is therefore unlikely to be implied by public-key encryption or even oblivious transfer.

* Applications. We present two types of applications of HSS. First, we construct 2-round protocols for secure multiparty computation from a simple constant-size instance of HSS. As a corollary, we obtain 2-round protocols with attractive asymptotic efficiency features under the Decision Diffie Hellman (DDH) assumption. Second, we use HSS to obtain nearly optimal worst-case to average-case reductions in P. This in turn has applications to fine-grained average-case hardness and verifiable computation.},

	title = {Approximate {Clustering} with {Same}-{Cluster} {Queries}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01862},
	abstract = {Ashtiani et al. proposed a Semi-Supervised Active Clustering framework (SSAC), where the learner is allowed to make adaptive queries to a domain expert. The queries are of the kind "do two given points belong to the same optimal cluster?" There are many clustering contexts where such same-cluster queries are feasible. Ashtiani et al. exhibited the power of such queries by showing that any instance of the \$k\$-means clustering problem, with additional margin assumption, can be solved efficiently if one is allowed \$O(k{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}log\{k\} + k {\textbackslash}log\{n\})\$ same-cluster queries. This is interesting since the \$k\$-means problem, even with the margin assumption, is \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{NP\}\$-hard. In this paper, we extend the work of Ashtiani et al. to the approximation setting showing that a few of such same-cluster queries enables one to get a polynomial-time \$(1 + {\textbackslash}varepsilon)\$-approximation algorithm for the \$k\$-means problem without any margin assumption on the input dataset. Again, this is interesting since the \$k\$-means problem is \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{NP\}\$-hard to approximate within a factor \$(1 + c)\$ for a fixed constant \$0 {\textless} c {\textless} 1\$. The number of same-cluster queries used is \${\textbackslash}textrm\{poly\}(k/{\textbackslash}varepsilon)\$ which is independent of the size \$n\$ of the dataset. Our algorithm is based on the \$D{\textasciicircum}2\$-sampling technique. We also give a conditional lower bound on the number of same-cluster queries showing that if the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) holds, then any such efficient query algorithm needs to make \${\textbackslash}Omega {\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}frac\{k\}\{poly {\textbackslash}log k\} {\textbackslash}right)\$ same-cluster queries. Our algorithm can be extended for the case when the oracle is faulty. Another result we show with respect to the \$k\$-means++ seeding algorithm is that a small modification to the \$k\$-means++ seeding algorithm within the SSAC framework converts it to a constant factor approximation algorithm instead of the well known \$O({\textbackslash}log\{k\})\$-approximation algorithm.},

	abstract = {Understanding the singular value spectrum of a matrix \$A {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{n {\textbackslash}times n\}\$ is a fundamental task in countless applications. In matrix multiplication time, it is possible to perform a full SVD and directly compute the singular values \${\textbackslash}sigma\_1,...,{\textbackslash}sigma\_n\$. However, little is known about algorithms that break this runtime barrier. Using tools from stochastic trace estimation, polynomial approximation, and fast system solvers, we show how to efficiently isolate different ranges of \$A\$'s spectrum and approximate the number of singular values in these ranges. We thus effectively compute a histogram of the spectrum, which can stand in for the true singular values in many applications. We use this primitive to give the first algorithms for approximating a wide class of symmetric matrix norms in faster than matrix multiplication time. For example, we give a \$(1 + {\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ approximation algorithm for the Schatten-\$1\$ norm (the nuclear norm) running in just \${\textbackslash}tilde O((nnz(A)n{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\} + n{\textasciicircum}2){\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-3\})\$ time for \$A\$ with uniform row sparsity or \${\textbackslash}tilde O(n{\textasciicircum}\{2.18\} {\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-3\})\$ time for dense matrices. The runtime scales smoothly for general Schatten-\$p\$ norms, notably becoming \${\textbackslash}tilde O (p {\textbackslash}cdot nnz(A) {\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}\{-3\})\$ for any \$p {\textbackslash}ge 2\$. At the same time, we show that the complexity of spectrum approximation is inherently tied to fast matrix multiplication in the small \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ regime. We prove that achieving milder \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ dependencies in our algorithms would imply faster than matrix multiplication time triangle detection for general graphs. This further implies that highly accurate algorithms running in subcubic time yield subcubic time matrix multiplication. As an application of our bounds, we show that precisely computing all effective resistances in a graph in less than matrix multiplication time is likely difficult, barring a major algorithmic breakthrough.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the quantum computing algorithms for Linear Algebra problems [HHL,TaShma] we study how the simulation on a classical computer of this type of "Phase Estimation algorithms" performs when we apply it to solve the Eigen-Problem of Hermitian matrices. The result is a completely new, efficient and stable, parallel algorithm to compute an approximate spectral decomposition of any Hermitian matrix. The algorithm can be implemented by Boolean circuits in \$O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2 n)\$ parallel time with a total cost of \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}omega+1\})\$ Boolean operations. This Boolean complexity matches the best known rigorous \$O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2 n)\$ parallel time algorithms, but unlike those algorithms our algorithm is (logarithmically) stable, so further improvements may lead to practical implementations. All previous efficient and rigorous approaches to solve the Eigen-Problem use randomization to avoid bad condition as we do too. Our algorithm makes further use of randomization in a completely new way, taking random powers of a unitary matrix to randomize the phases of its eigenvalues. Proving that a tiny Gaussian perturbation and a random polynomial power are sufficient to ensure almost pairwise independence of the phases \$({\textbackslash}mod (2{\textbackslash}pi))\$ is the main technical contribution of this work. This randomization enables us, given a Hermitian matrix with well separated eigenvalues, to sample a random eigenvalue and produce an approximate eigenvector in \$O({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2 n)\$ parallel time and \$O(n{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}omega)\$ Boolean complexity. We conjecture that further improvements of our method can provide a stable solution to the full approximate spectral decomposition problem with complexity similar to the complexity (up to a logarithmic factor) of sampling a single eigenvector.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08558},
	abstract = {Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) was introduced by Indyk and Motwani (STOC `98) to give the first sublinear time algorithm for the c-approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) problem using only polynomial space. At a high level, an LSH family hashes "nearby" points to the same bucket and "far away" points to different buckets. The quality of measure of an LSH family is its LSH exponent, which helps determine both query time and space usage. In a seminal work, Andoni and Indyk (FOCS `06) constructed an LSH family based on random ball partitioning of space that achieves an LSH exponent of 1/c{\textasciicircum}2 for the l\_2 norm, which was later shown to be optimal by Motwani, Naor and Panigrahy (SIDMA `07) and O'Donnell, Wu and Zhou (TOCT `14). Although optimal in the LSH exponent, the ball partitioning approach is computationally expensive. So, in the same work, Andoni and Indyk proposed a simpler and more practical hashing scheme based on Euclidean lattices and provided computational results using the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. However, no theoretical analysis of the scheme was given, thus leaving open the question of finding the exponent of lattice based LSH. In this work, we resolve this question by showing the existence of lattices achieving the optimal LSH exponent of 1/c{\textasciicircum}2 using techniques from the geometry of numbers. At a more conceptual level, our results show that optimal LSH space partitions can have periodic structure. Understanding the extent to which additional structure can be imposed on these partitions, e.g. to yield low space and query complexity, remains an important open problem.},

	abstract = {We consider the techniques behind the current best algorithms for matrix multiplication. Our results are threefold. (1) We provide a unifying framework, showing that all known matrix multiplication running times since 1986 can be achieved from a single very natural tensor - the structural tensor \$T\_q\$ of addition modulo an integer \$q\$. (2) We show that if one applies a generalization of the known techniques (arbitrary zeroing out of tensor powers to obtain independent matrix products in order to use the asymptotic sum inequality of Sch{\textbackslash}"\{o\}nhage) to an arbitrary monomial degeneration of \$T\_q\$, then there is an explicit lower bound, depending on \$q\$, on the bound on the matrix multiplication exponent \${\textbackslash}omega\$ that one can achieve. We also show upper bounds on the value \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ that one can achieve, where \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ is such that \$n{\textbackslash}times n{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}times n\$ matrix multiplication can be computed in \$n{\textasciicircum}\{2+o(1)\}\$ time. (3) We show that our lower bound on \${\textbackslash}omega\$ approaches \$2\$ as \$q\$ goes to infinity. This suggests a promising approach to improving the bound on \${\textbackslash}omega\$: for variable \$q\$, find a monomial degeneration of \$T\_q\$ which, using the known techniques, produces an upper bound on \${\textbackslash}omega\$ as a function of \$q\$. Then, take \$q\$ to infinity. It is not ruled out, and hence possible, that one can obtain \${\textbackslash}omega=2\$ in this way.},

We then establish a complementary arithmetic counting lemma that counts arithmetic patterns in the nilsequence component of f. We provide a number of applications of these lemmas: a proof of Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progressions, a proof of a conjecture of Bergelson, Host and Kra, and a generalisation of certain results of Gowers and Wolf.

In this paper, we investigate the problem in a principled and systematic manner. We develop a unified parametric model and a series of four instance measures. Those instance similarity measures not only address a spectrum of various meanings of similarity, but also present a series of tradeoffs between computational cost and strictness of matching between neighborhoods of nodes being compared. By extensive experiments and case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its instances.},

An attractive characteristic of our approach is that it is based on optimizing a well-defined objective function, and thus, contrary to previous approaches, the role-discovery task can be studied with the tools of combinatorial optimization. We demonstrate that, when fixing the number of roles to be used, the proposed role-discovery problem is np-hard, while another (seemingly easier) version of the problem is np-hard to approximate. On the positive side, despite the recursive nature of our objective function, we can show that finding a perfect (zero-cost) role assignment with the minimum number of roles can be solved in polynomial time. We do this by connecting the zero-cost role assignment with the notion of equitable partition. For the more practical version of the problem with fixed number of roles we present two natural heuristic methods, and discuss how to make them scalable in large graphs.},

We use non-overlapping snapshots of the interaction network and develop the framework for a unified dynamic group identification and tracklet association. The approach is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively on videos of pedestrian scenes where manually labeled ground-truth is given. The results of our approach are consistent to human-perceived dynamic social groups of the crowd.

Since social roles are described by the interaction between people in an event, we propose a Conditional Random Field to model the inter-role interactions, along with person specific social descriptors. We develop tractable variational inference to simultaneously infer model weights, as well as role assignment to all people in the videos. We also present a novel YouTube social roles dataset with ground truth role annotations, and introduce annotations on a subset of videos from the TRECVID-MED11 [1] event kits for evaluation purposes. The performance of the model is compared against different baseline methods on these datasets.},

	abstract = {Role discovery in graphs is an emerging area that allows analysis of complex graphs in an intuitive way. In contrast to other graph prob- lems such as community discovery, which finds groups of highly connected nodes, the role discovery problem finds groups of nodes that share similar graph topological structure. However, existing work so far has two severe limitations that prevent its use in some domains. Firstly, it is completely unsupervised which is undesirable for a number of reasons. Secondly, most work is limited to a single relational graph. We address both these lim- itations in an intuitive and easy to implement alternating least squares framework. Our framework allows convex constraints to be placed on the role discovery problem which can provide useful supervision. In par- ticular we explore supervision to enforce i) sparsity, ii) diversity and iii) alternativeness. We then show how to lift this work for multi-relational graphs. A natural representation of a multi-relational graph is an order 3 tensor (rather than a matrix) and that a Tucker decomposition allows us to find complex interactions between collections of entities (E-groups) and the roles they play for a combination of relations (R-groups). Existing Tucker decomposition methods in tensor toolboxes are not suited for our purpose, so we create our own algorithm that we demonstrate is pragmatically useful.},

	abstract = {Roles represent node-level connectivity patterns such as star-center, star-edge nodes, near-cliques or nodes that act as bridges to different regions of the graph. Intuitively, two nodes belong to the same role if they are structurally similar. Roles have been mainly of interest to sociologists, but more recently, roles have become increasingly useful in other domains. Traditionally, the notion of roles were defined based on graph equivalences such as structural, regular, and stochastic equivalences. We briefly revisit these early notions and instead propose a more general formulation of roles based on the similarity of a feature representation (in contrast to the graph representation). This leads us to propose a taxonomy of three general classes of techniques for discovering roles that includes (i) graph-based roles, (ii) feature-based roles, and (iii) hybrid roles. We also propose a flexible framework for discovering roles using the notion of similarity on a feature-based representation. The framework consists of two fundamental components: (a) role feature construction and (b) role assignment using the learned feature representation. We discuss the different possibilities for discovering feature-based roles and the tradeoffs of the many techniques for computing them. Finally, we discuss potential applications and future directions and challenges.},

While studying such complex systems, it is important not only to detect synchronized states, but also to identify causal relationships (i.e. who drives whom) between concerned (sub) systems. The knowledge of information-theoretic measures (i.e. mutual information, conditional entropy) is essential for the analysis of information flow between two systems or between constituent subsystems of a complex system. However, the estimation of these measures from a set of finite samples is not trivial. The current extensive literatures on entropy and mutual information estimation provides a wide variety of approaches, from approximation-statistical, studying rate of convergence or consistency of an estimator for a general distribution, over learning algorithms operating on partitioned data space to heuristical approaches. The aim of this paper is to provide a detailed overview of information theoretic approaches for measuring causal influence in multivariate time series and to focus on diverse approaches to the entropy and mutual information estimation.},

	abstract = {Data from social media provide unprecedented opportunities to investigate the processes that govern the dynamics of collective social phenomena. We consider an information theoretical approach to define and measure the temporal and structural signatures typical of collective social events as they arise and gain prominence. We use the symbolic transfer entropy analysis of microblogging time series to extract directed networks of influence among geolocalized subunits in social systems. This methodology captures the emergence of system-level dynamics close to the onset of socially relevant collective phenomena. The framework is validated against a detailed empirical analysis of five case studies. In particular, we identify a change in the characteristic time scale of the information transfer that flags the onset of information-driven collective phenomena. Furthermore, our approach identifies an order-disorder transition in the directed network of influence between social subunits. In the absence of clear exogenous driving, social collective phenomena can be represented as endogenously driven structural transitions of the information transfer network. This study provides results that can help define models and predictive algorithms for the analysis of societal events based on open source data.
This work defines the framework to explore the spatiotemporal signature of emergent collective phenomena on social media.

In social networks, the propensity of nodes to engage in social interactions (activity) and their chances to be selected by active nodes (attractiveness) are heterogeneously distributed. Here, we present a time-varying network model where each node and the dynamical formation of ties are characterized by these two features. We study how these properties affect random-walk processes unfolding on the network when the time scales describing the process and the network evolution are comparable. We derive analytical solutions for the stationary state and the mean first-passage time of the process, and we study cases informed by empirical observations of social networks. Our work shows that previously disregarded properties of real social systems, such as heterogeneous distributions of activity and attractiveness as well as the correlations between them, substantially affect the dynamical process unfolding on the network.},

Typically, control has multiple prerequisites: it requires an accurate map of the network that governs the interactions between the system’s components, a quantitative description of the dynamical laws that govern the temporal behavior of each component, and an ability to influence the state and temporal behavior of a selected subset of the components. With deep roots in dynamical systems and control theory, notions of control and controllability have taken a new life recently in the study of complex networks, inspiring several fundamental questions: What are the control principles of complex systems? How do networks organize themselves to balance control with functionality? To address these questions here recent advances on the controllability and the control of complex networks are reviewed, exploring the intricate interplay between the network topology and dynamical laws. The pertinent mathematical results are matched with empirical findings and applications. Uncovering the control principles of complex systems can help us explore and ultimately understand the fundamental laws that govern their behavior.},

	abstract = {Eigenstructure control involves modification of both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a system using feedback. Based on this key concept, algorithms are derived for the design of control systems using controller structures such as state feedback, output feedback, observer-based dynamic feedback, implicit and explicit modelfollowing, etc. The simple-to-use algorithms are well suited to evolve practical engineering solutions. The design of control laws for modern fly-by-wire high performance aircraft/rotorcraft offers some unique design challenges. The control laws have to provide a satisfactory interface between the pilot and the vehicle that results in good handling qualities (HQ) in precision control tasks. This book, through detailed aircraft and rotorcraft design examples, illustrates how to develop practical, robust flight control laws to meet these HQ requirements. This book demonstrates that eigenstructure control theory can be easily adapted and infused into the aircraft industry\&apos;s stringent design practices; therefore practicing flight control engineers will find it useful to explore the use of the new design concepts discussed. The book, being interdisciplinary in nature, encompassing control theory and flight dynamics, should be of interest to both control and aeronautical engineers. In particular, control researchers will find it interesting to explore an extension of the theory to new multivariable control problem formulations. Finally, the book should be of interest to graduate/doctoral students keen on learning a multivariable control technique that is useful in the design of practical control systems.},

The principles, existence conditions and design procedures are presented. The main contribution of the paper is the development of the assignment of right observer eigenvectors for robust residual generation. When some of the observer right eigenvectors are assigned parallel to the disturbance distribution directions, the diagnostic residual generated by the observer is insensitive to disturbances. Robust fault-detection design can be achieved by either left or right eigenvector assignment method. For left eigenvector assignment method, the sufficient conditions are presented. For right eigenvector assignment method, both necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed. Finally, two numerical examples are used to illustrate the eigenstructure assignment methods studied in the paper. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The ultimate goal of robustness is to provide rapid and reliable detection and isolation of system faults when the plant under control is disturbed, and when the mathematical model upon which the diagnosis is based cannot faithfully reproduce the full dynamic operation of the plant. The aim of this paper is to give the state-of-the-art in robust fault diagnosis, based principally on residual generation.

The robustness issues are then defined and ideas for improving the robustness properties are outlined.

	abstract = {Fault detection filters are a special class of observers that can generate directional residuals for the purpose of fault isolation. This paper proposes a new approach to design robust (in the disturbance de-coupling sense) fault detection filters which ensure that the residual vector, generated by this filter, has both robust and directional properties. This is done by combining the unknown input observer and fault detection filter principles. The paper proposes a new full-order unknown input observer, and gives necessary and sufficient conditions for its existence. After the disturbance de-coupling conditions are satisfied, the remaining design freedom can be used to make the residual have the directional property, based on the fault detection filter principle. A nonlinear jet engine system is used to illustrate the robust fault isolation approach presented. It is shown that linearization errors can be approximately treated as unknown disturbances and be de-coupled in the design of a robust fault detection filter. Simulation results show that mis-isolation of faults can be avoided using the robust scheme.},

A problem formulation is first proposed to address the optimization of the fault detection filter (FDF) design, which is expressed in terms of maximizing a finite horizon H∞/H∞ or H−/H∞ performance index. This formulation can be applied to FDF design of LDTV systems subject to l2-norm bounded unknown inputs or stochastic noise sequences. It is shown that a unified optimal solution to the FDF can be obtained by solving the discrete time Riccati equation and the optimal FDF is not unique. A numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed method.},

This extends the attack surface to include the potential for sophisticated cyber attacks, which can adversely impact ICS operation, resulting in service interruption, equipment damage, safety concerns, and associated financial implications. In this work, a novel cyber–physical security framework for ICSs is proposed, which incorporates an analytics tool for attack detection and executes a reliable estimation-based attack-resilient control policy, whenever an attack is detected. The proposed framework is adaptable to already implemented ICS and the stability and optimal performance of the controlled system under attack has been proved. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a reduced order model of a real EMS site and simulated attacks.},

	abstract = {The tight interaction between information technology and the physical world inherent in cyber–physical systems (CPS) can challenge traditional approaches for monitoring safety and security. Data collected for robust CPS monitoring is often sparse and may lack rich training data describing critical events/attacks. Moreover, CPS often operate in diverse environments that can have significant inter/intra-system variability. Furthermore, CPS monitors that are not robust to data sparsity and inter/intra-system variability may result in inconsistent performance and may not be trusted for monitoring safety and security. Towards overcoming these challenges, this paper presents recent work on the design of parameter-invariant (PAIN) monitors for CPS. PAIN monitors are designed such that unknown events and system variability minimally affect the monitor performance. This work describes how PAIN designs can achieve a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) in the presence of data sparsity and intra/inter system variance in real-world CPS. To demonstrate the design of PAIN monitors for safety monitoring in CPS with different types of dynamics, we consider systems with networked dynamics, linear-time invariant dynamics, and hybrid dynamics that are discussed through case studies for building actuator fault detection, meal detection in type I diabetes, and detecting hypoxia caused by pulmonary shunts in infants. In all applications, the PAIN monitor is shown to have (significantly) less variance in monitoring performance and (often) outperforms other competing approaches in the literature. Finally, an initial application of PAIN monitoring for CPS security is presented along with challenges and research directions for future security monitoring deployments.},

Countermeasures for these attacks are equally diverse, which include architecture, design, implementation, and validation-based protection. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the security infrastructure in modern SoC designs, including both resiliency techniques and their validation paradigms at presilicon and postsilicon stages.

Advances in CPSs and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) requires us to take a unified view of safety and security. This paper defines a safety/security threat model for CPSs and IoT systems and surveys emerging techniques which improve the safety and security of CPSs and IoT systems.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently widely used for many artificial intelligence (AI) applications including computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics. While DNNs deliver state-of-the-art accuracy on many AI tasks, it comes at the cost of high computational complexity. Accordingly, techniques that enable efficient processing of DNNs to improve energy efficiency and throughput without sacrificing application accuracy or increasing hardware cost are critical to the wide deployment of DNNs in AI systems. This article aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial and survey about the recent advances toward the goal of enabling efficient processing of DNNs. Specifically, it will provide an overview of DNNs, discuss various hardware platforms and architectures that support DNNs, and highlight key trends in reducing the computation cost of DNNs either solely via hardware design changes or via joint hardware design and DNN algorithm changes. It will also summarize various development resources that enable researchers and practitioners to quickly get started in this field, and highlight important benchmarking metrics and design considerations that should be used for evaluating the rapidly growing number of DNN hardware designs, optionally including algorithmic codesigns, being proposed in academia and industry. The reader will take away the following concepts from this article: understand the key design considerations for DNNs; be able to evaluate different DNN hardware implementations with benchmarks and comparison metrics; understand the tradeoffs between various hardware architectures and platforms; be able to evaluate the utility of various DNN design techniques for efficient processing; and understand recent implementation trends and opportunities.},

In this new problem, each user needs to encode his or her own unique secret message without collaboration with other users and without the use of any common secret materials or cryptographic keys. The goal is to ensure that an adversary without access to all of the encoded messages learns as little as possible about the secret messages, while a legitimate joint decoder with all the encoded messages can decode all of them without cryptographic keys. Furthermore the users do not know the channels that will be compromised ahead of time, and thus must protect all channels. Specifically, we study two related variants of this problem. The first problem deals with source coding and secrecy, while the second problem deals with channel coding and secrecy. From the results of these two problems, we conclude that interference is necessary for unconditional secrecy.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of secret sharing when the dealer does not have direct communication links to all the participants, and instead, the dealer and the participants form a general network. Existing methods are based on separate secure message transmissions from the dealer to each participant, requiring considerable coordination and communication in the network. We present a distributed algorithm for disseminating shares over a network, which we call the “SNEAK” algorithm, requiring each node to know only the identities of its one-hop neighbors. While SNEAK imposes a stronger condition on the network by requiring the dealer to be what we call k-propagating rather than k-connected as required by the existing solutions, we show that in addition to being distributed, it achieves significant reduction in the amount of communication and the randomness required. We also derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the amount of communication for secret sharing over networks, which may be of independent interest.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of secret sharing when the dealer does not have direct communication links to all participants, and instead, they form a general network. We present an algorithm for secret sharing over networks that satisfy what we call the k-propagating-dealer condition. The algorithm is communication-efficient, distributed and deterministic. Interestingly, the solution constitutes an instance of a network coding problem admitting a distributed and deterministic solution, and furthermore, handles the case of nodal-eavesdropping, about which very little appears to be known in the literature. In the second part of the paper, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret sharing over any network, which may also be of independent interest. We show that for networks satisfying the k-propagating-dealer condition, the communication complexity of our algorithm is Θ(n), and furthermore, is always within a constant factor of the lower bound. We also show that, in contrast, existing solutions in the literature entail a communication-complexity that is superlinear for a wide class of networks, and is Θ(n2) in the worst case. Our algorithm thus allows for efficient generalization of several cryptographic protocols to a large class of networks.},

The book starts from first principles, so that no previous knowledge of probability is necessary. However, the work is rigorous and mathematical, making it useful to engineers and mathematicians, even those not interested in biological applications. A range of exercises is provided, including drills to familiarize the reader with concepts and more advanced problems that require deep thinking about the theory. Biological applications are taken from post-genomic biology, especially genomics and proteomics.The topics examined include standard material such as the Perron-Frobenius theorem, transient and recurrent states, hitting probabilities and hitting times, maximum likelihood estimation, the Viterbi algorithm, and the Baum-Welch algorithm. The book contains discussions of extremely useful topics not usually seen at the basic level, such as ergodicity of Markov processes, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), information theory, and large deviation theory for both i.i.d and Markov processes. The book also presents state-of-the-art realization theory for hidden Markov models. Among biological applications, it offers an in-depth look at the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Technique) algorithm, including a comprehensive explanation of the underlying theory. Other applications such as profile hidden Markov models are also explored.First published in 2014.},

The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given.

The author formulates many open problems and offers several conjectures, providing arguments which may be followed by anyone familiar with basic graph theory and algorithms. This work may be applied to robotics and artificial intelligence as well as other fields, and will be especially useful to computer scientists working with computational and combinatorial geometry.},

	abstract = {Summary
The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effectiveness of standard earmuffs and noise-cancelling (NC) headphones in controlling behavioural problems related to hyper-reactivity to auditory stimuli in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty-one children with ASD aged 4–16 years (16 boys and 5 girls), after a 2-week nonwearing baseline period, were asked to use standard earmuffs and NC headphones for 2 weeks, in a random order. Parents or teachers rated participants' behaviours that were related to their reaction to auditory stimuli. Four participants refused to wear either the earmuffs or the NC headphones. It was found that the T-score on the Goal Attainment Scaling was significantly higher during the earmuff period than that in the baseline period (Z = 2.726, p = .006). The behaviours of 5 children with ASD improved during the NC headphone period as compared with those in the baseline period; there were no differences in the T-scores on the Goal Attainment Scaling between the NC headphone period and the baseline period (Z = 1.689, p = .091) and between the earmuff and NC headphone periods (Z = −0.451, p = .678). This study demonstrated the effectiveness of standard earmuffs and NC headphones in helping children with ASD to cope with problem behaviours related to hyper-reactivity to auditory stimuli, therefore, children with ASD could use earmuffs to help to deal with unpleasant sensory auditory stimuli.},

From the theoretical perspective, this study can be considered as the first attempt to formulate the idea of mining maximal frequent subgraphs in the challenging domain of messy visual data, and as a conceptual extension to the unsupervised learning of graph matching. We define a soft attributed pattern (SAP) to represent the common subgraph pattern among a set of attributed relational graphs (ARGs), considering both their structure and attributes. Regarding the differences between ARGs with fuzzy attributes and conventional labeled graphs, we propose a new mining strategy that directly extracts the SAP with the maximal graph size without applying node enumeration. Given an initial graph template and a number of ARGs, we develop an unsupervised method to modify the graph template into the maximal-size SAP. From a practical perspective, this research develops a general platform for learning the category model (i.e., the SAP) from cluttered visual data (i.e., the ARGs) without labeling “what is where,” thereby opening the possibility for a series of applications in the era of big visual data. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method on RGB/RGB-D images and videos.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, the use of graph-based object representation has drastically increased. As a matter of fact, object representation by means of graphs has a number of advantages over feature vectors. As a consequence, methods to compare graphs have become of first interest. In this paper, a graph matching method and a distance between attributed graphs are defined. Both approaches are based on subgraphs. In this context, subgraphs can be seen as structural features extracted from a given graph, their nature enables them to represent local information of a root node. Given two graphs G1,G2, the univalent mapping can be expressed as the minimum-weight subgraph matching between G1 and G2 with respect to a cost function. This metric between subgraphs is directly derived from well-known graph distances. In experiments on four different data sets, the distance induced by our graph matching was applied to measure the accuracy of the graph matching. Finally, we demonstrate a substantial speed-up compared to conventional methods while keeping a relevant precision.},

While recently proposed kernels based on common subgraphs (Wale et al., 2008; Shervashidze et al., 2009) in general can not be applied to attributed graphs, our approach allows to rate mappings of subgraphs by a flexible scoring scheme comparing vertex and edge attributes by kernels. We show that subgraph matching kernels generalize several known kernels. To compute the kernel we propose a graph-theoretical algorithm inspired by a classical relation between common subgraphs of two graphs and cliques in their product graph observed by Levi (1973). Encouraging experimental results on a classification task of real-world graphs are presented.},

	abstract = {Design of filters for graph signal processing benefits from knowledge of the spectral decomposition of matrices that encode graphs, such as the adjacency matrix and the Laplacian matrix, used to define the shift operator. For shift matrices with real eigenvalues, which arise for symmetric graphs, the empirical spectral distribution captures the eigenvalue locations. Under realistic circumstances, stochastic influences often affect the network structure and, consequently, the shift matrix empirical spectral distribution. Nevertheless, deterministic functions may often be found to approximate the asymptotic behavior of empirical spectral distributions of random matrices. This paper uses stochastic canonical equation methods developed by Girko to derive such deterministic equivalent distributions for the empirical spectral distributions of random graphs formed by structured, non-uniform percolation of a D-dimensional lattice supergraph. Included simulations demonstrate the results for sample parameters.},

Several statistical isolation methods are revisited, using both a linear-transform formulation and the information content of the corresponding residuals. We formally state several multiple-fault cases, with or without causality assumptions, and discuss an optimality criterion for the most general one.

	doi = {10.1109/TIT.2013.2267934},
	abstract = {Four estimators of the directed information rate between a pair of jointly stationary ergodic finite-alphabet processes are proposed, based on universal probability assignments. The first one is a Shannon-McMillan-Breiman-type estimator, similar to those used by Verdú in 2005 and Cai in 2006 for estimation of other information measures. We show the almost sure and L1 convergence properties of the estimator for any underlying universal probability assignment. The other three estimators map universal probability assignments to different functionals, each exhibiting relative merits such as smoothness, nonnegativity, and boundedness. We establish the consistency of these estimators in almost sure and L1 senses, and derive near-optimal rates of convergence in the minimax sense under mild conditions. These estimators carry over directly to estimating other information measures of stationary ergodic finite-alphabet processes, such as entropy rate and mutual information rate, with near-optimal performance and provide alternatives to classical approaches in the existing literature. Guided by these theoretical results, the proposed estimators are implemented using the context-tree weighting algorithm as the universal probability assignment. Experiments on synthetic and real data are presented, demonstrating the potential of the proposed schemes in practice and the utility of directed information estimation in detecting and measuring causal influence and delay.},

	abstract = {This report reviews the conceptual and theoretical links between Granger causality and directed information theory. We begin with a short historical tour of Granger causality, concentrating on its closeness to information theory. The definitions of Granger causality based on prediction are recalled, and the importance of the observation set is discussed. We present the definitions based on conditional independence. The notion of instantaneous coupling is included in the definitions. The concept of Granger causality graphs is discussed. We present directed information theory from the perspective of studies of causal influences between stochastic processes. Causal conditioning appears to be the cornerstone for the relation between information theory and Granger causality. In the bivariate case, the fundamental measure is the directed information, which decomposes as the sum of the transfer entropies and a term quantifying instantaneous coupling. We show the decomposition of the mutual information into the sums of the transfer entropies and the instantaneous coupling measure, a relation known for the linear Gaussian case. We study the multivariate case, showing that the useful decomposition is blurred by instantaneous coupling. The links are further developed by studying how measures based on directed information theory naturally emerge from Granger causality inference frameworks as hypothesis testing.},

In this article, the authors describe the measurement-based statistical models useful to describe time-of-arrival (TOA), angle-of-arrival (AOA), and received-signal-strength (RSS) measurements in wireless sensor networks. Wideband and ultra-wideband (UWB) measurements, and RF and acoustic media are also discussed. Using the models, the authors have shown the calculation of a Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the location estimation precision possible for a given set of measurements. The article briefly surveys a large and growing body of sensor localization algorithms.

	abstract = {Hierarchical secret sharing is among the most natural generalizations of threshold secret sharing, and it has attracted a lot of attention from the invention of secret sharing until nowadays. Several constructions of ideal hierarchical secret sharing schemes have been proposed, but it was not known what access structures admit such a scheme. We solve this problem by providing a natural definition for the family of the hierarchical access structures and, more importantly, by presenting a complete characterization of the ideal hierarchical access structures, that is, the ones admitting an ideal secret sharing scheme. Our characterization deals with the properties of the hierarchically minimal sets of the access structure, which are the minimal qualified sets whose participants are in the lowest possible levels in the hierarchy. By using our characterization, it can be efficiently checked whether any given hierarchical access structure that is defined by its hierarchically minimal sets is ideal. We use the well known connection between ideal secret sharing and matroids and, in particular, the fact that every ideal access structure is a matroid port. In addition, we use recent results on ideal multipartite access structures and the connection between multipartite matroids and integer polymatroids. We prove that every ideal hierarchical access structure is the port of a representable matroid and, more specifically, we prove that every ideal structure in this family admits ideal linear secret sharing schemes over fields of all characteristics. In addition, methods to construct such ideal schemes can be derived from the results in this paper and the aforementioned ones on ideal multipartite secret sharing. Finally, we use our results to find a new proof for the characterization of the ideal weighted threshold access structures that is simpler than the existing one.},

A key component in the definition is taking an infimum over all possible partitions of the time interval, which plays a role no less significant than the supremum over “space” partitions inherent in the definition of mutual information. Properties and operational interpretations in estimation and communication are then established for the proposed notion of directed information. For the continuous-time additive white Gaussian noise channel, it is shown that Duncan's classical relationship between causal estimation error and mutual information continues to hold in the presence of feedback upon replacing mutual information by directed information. A parallel result is established for the Poisson channel. The utility of this relationship is demonstrated in computing the directed information rate between the input and output processes of a continuous-time Poisson channel with feedback, where the channel input process is constrained to be constant between events at the channel output. Finally, the capacity of a wide class of continuous-time channels with feedback is established via directed information, characterizing the fundamental limit on reliable communication.},

	abstract = {We propose a graphical model for representing networks of stochastic processes, the minimal generative model graph. It is based on reduced factorizations of the joint distribution over time. We show that under appropriate conditions, it is unique and consistent with another type of graphical model, the directed information graph, which is based on a generalization of Granger causality. We demonstrate how directed information quantifies Granger causality in a particular sequential prediction setting. We also develop efficient methods to estimate the topological structure from data that obviate estimating the joint statistics. One algorithm assumes upper-bounds on the degrees and uses the minimal dimension statistics necessary. In the event that the upper-bounds are not valid, the resulting graph is nonetheless an optimal approximation. Another algorithm uses near-minimal dimension statistics when no bounds are known but the distribution satisfies a certain criterion. Analogous to how structure learning algorithms for undirected graphical models use mutual information estimates, these algorithms use directed information estimates. We characterize the sample-complexity of two plug-in directed information estimators and obtain confidence intervals. For the setting when point estimates are unreliable, we propose an algorithm that uses confidence intervals to identify the best approximation that is robust to estimation error. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through analysis of both synthetic data and real data from the Twitter network. In the latter case, we identify which news sources influence users in the network by merely analyzing tweet times.},

This upper bound is tight for gambling in a horse race, which is an extreme case of stock markets. Directed information also characterizes the value of causal side information in instantaneous compression and quantifies the benefit of causal inference in joint compression of two stochastic processes. In hypothesis testing, directed information evaluates the best error exponent for testing whether a random process Y causally influences another process X or not. These results lead to a natural interpretation of directed information I(Yn → Xn) as the amount of information that a random sequence Yn = (Y1,Y2,..., Yn) causally provides about another random sequence Xn = (X1,X2,...,Xn). A new measure, directed lautum information, is also introduced and interpreted in portfolio theory, data compression, and hypothesis testing.},

We particularly insist on the implication of two notions of causality that may occur in physical systems. It is well accepted that dynamical causality is assessed by the conditional transfer entropy, a measure appearing naturally as a part of directed information. Surprisingly the notion of instantaneous causality is often overlooked, even if it was clearly understood in early works. In the bivariate case, instantaneous coupling is measured adequately by the instantaneous information exchange, a measure that supplements the transfer entropy in the decomposition of directed information. In this paper, the focus is put on the multivariate case and conditional graph modeling issues. In this framework, we show that the decomposition of directed information into the sum of transfer entropy and information exchange does not hold anymore. Nevertheless, the discussion allows to put forward the two measures as pillars for the inference of causality graphs.

	abstract = {A new approach toward increasing spatial resolution is required to overcome the limitations of the sensors and optics manufacturing technology. One promising approach is to use signal processing techniques to obtain an high-resolution (HR) image (or sequence) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been one of the most active research areas, and it is called super resolution (SR) (or HR) image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement. In this article, we use the term "SR image reconstruction" to refer to a signal processing approach toward resolution enhancement because the term "super" in "super resolution" represents very well the characteristics of the technique overcoming the inherent resolution limitation of LR imaging systems. The major advantage of the signal processing approach is that it may cost less and the existing LR imaging systems can be still utilized. The SR image reconstruction is proved to be useful in many practical cases where multiple frames of the same scene can be obtained, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts. To this purpose, we present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed.

	abstract = {The concept of coherence is fundamental and quite important in all fields dealing with fluctuating quantities. Although there is a commonality among the many uses of the term coherence, the precise meaning of this term seems to vary from one field to another and even within some fields. The purpose of this tutorial paper is to present a unifying view of the concept of coherence that is particularly relevant to the related fields of statistical signal processing and time-series analysis, which permeate numerous other more specialized fields. Precise mathematical definitions of a variety of types of coherence are given and are related to commonly used physical meanings. A brief survey of methods, which can be implemented with digital signal processing algorithms, for exploiting the various types of coherence that can occur in measurements of fluctuating quantities is presented. Of the three types of coherence - temporal, spectral and spatial - some emphasis is placed on spectral coherence since its use in signal processing has received the least attention in the literature.
Zusammenfassung
Das Konzept der Kohärenz ist fundamental und sehr wichtig auf allen Gebieten, bei denen es um veränderliche Größen geht. Obwohl es eine Gemeinsamkeit in den vielfältigen Anwendungen des Begriffs Kohärenz gibt, variiert die genaue Bedeutung dieses Ausdrucks in den unterschiedlichen Anwendungsbereichen und sogar innerhalb einzelner Bereiche. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Übersichtsarbeit besteht darin, eine einheitliche Darstellung des Konzeptes der Kohärenz in Hinblick auf statistische Signalverarbeitung und Zeitfolgen-Analyse zu geben, womit auch zahlreiche andere speziellere Gebiete erfaßt werden. Präzise mathematische Definitionen einer Vielfalt von Typen von Kohärenz werden gegeben und mit den gemeinhin benutzten physikalischen Bedeutungen verlichen. Es wird ein kurzer Überblick über die Anwendungsmöglichkeiten der verschiedenen Typen von Kohärenz wiedergegeben, die sich im Bereich der Messung veränderlicher Größen anbieten. Von den drei grundsätzlichen Typen von Kohärenz - zeitlich, spektral und räumlich - wird das Gewicht auf die spektrale Kohärenz gelegt, da ihre Anwendung bisher die geringste Aufmerksamkeit in der Literaur erfahren hat.
Résumé
Le concept de cohérence est fondamental et tout à fait important dans tous les domaines traitant de quantités fluctuantes. Bien qu'il ait un principe commun aux usages nombreux du terme cohérence, la signification précise de ce terme semble varier quelque peu d'un domaine à un autre et même à l'intérieur e certains domaines. Le but de cet article à caractère pédagogique est de présenter une vue unificatrice du concept de cohérence particulièrement adaptée aux domaines apparentés du traitement statistique du signal et de l'analyse de séries temporelles, qui ont une influence sur bon nombre d'autres domaines plus spécialisés. Des définitions mathématiques précise d'une variété de types de cohérence sont données et reliées aux interprétations physiques couramment utilisées. Un bref rappel des façons possibles d'utiliser les divers types de cohérence pouvant intervenir lors de la mesure de quantités fluctuantes est présenté. Des trois types de base de cohérence - temporelle, spectrale et spatiale - l'accent est mis sur la cohérence spatiale du fait que son utilisation en traitement du signal a reçu moins d'attention dans la littérature.},

The physical justification of these concepts and examples are also given. The graph of a pair (A,b) is also defined. This gives another way of describing the structure of this pair. The property of structural controllability is reduced to a property of the graph of the pair (A,b). To do this, the basic concept of a "cactus" and the related concept of a "precactus" are introduced. The main result of this paper states that the pair (A,b) is structurally controllable if an only if the graph of (A,b) is "spanned by a cactus." The result is also expressed in a more conventional way, in terms of some properties of the pair (A,b).},

	abstract = {The process by which new ideas, innovations, and behaviors spread through a large social network can be thought of as a networked interaction game: Each agent obtains information from certain number of agents in his friendship neighborhood, and adapts his idea or behavior to increase his benefit. In this paper, we are interested in how opinions, about a certain topic, form in social networks. We model opinions as continuous scalars ranging from 0 to 1 with 1(0) representing extremely positive(negative) opinion. Each agent has an initial opinion and incurs some cost depending on the opinions of his neighbors, his initial opinion, and his stubbornness about his initial opinion. Agents iteratively update their opinions based on their own initial opinions and observing the opinions of their neighbors. The iterative update of an agent can be viewed as a myopic cost-minimization response (i.e., the so-called best response) to the others' actions. We study whether an equilibrium can emerge as a result of such local interactions and how such equilibrium possibly depends on the network structure, initial opinions of the agents, and the location of stubborn agents and the extent of their stubbornness. We also study the convergence speed to such equilibrium and characterize the convergence time as a function of aforementioned factors. We also discuss the implications of such results in a few well-known graphs including small-world graphs.},

	abstract = {We present the first single pass algorithm for computing spectral sparsifiers for graphs in the dynamic semi-streaming model. Given a single pass over a stream containing insertions and deletions of edges to a graph \$G\$, our algorithm maintains a randomized linear sketch of the incidence matrix of \$G\$ into dimension \$O ({\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2\}n\{polylog\} (n))\$. Using this sketch, at any point, the algorithm can output a \$(1 {\textbackslash}pm {\textbackslash}epsilon)\$ spectral sparsifier for \$G\$ with high probability. While \$O ({\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2\} n\{polylog\}(n))\$ space algorithms are known for computing cut sparsifiers in dynamic streams [K. J. Ahn, S. Guha, and A. McGregor, in Proceedings of the 31st ACM Symposium on  Principles of Database Systems, 2012, pp. 5--14; A. Goel, M. Kapralov, and I. Post, {\textbackslash}hrefhttp://arXiv.org/abs/1203.4900 arXiv:1203.4900, 2002] and spectral sparsifiers in insertion-only streams [J. A. Kelner and A. Levin, Theory Comput. Syst., 53 (2013), pp. 243--262], prior to our work, the best known single pass algorithm for maintaining spectral sparsifiers in dynamic streams required sketches  of dimension \${\textbackslash}Omega ({\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}epsilon{\textasciicircum}2\}n{\textasciicircum}\{5/3\})\$ [K. J. Ahn, S. Guha, and A. McGregor, in Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Approximation Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problems, 2013, pp. 1--10]. To achieve our result, we show that using a coarse sparsifier for  \$G\$ and a linear sketch of \$G\$'s incidence matrix, it is possible to sample edges by effective resistance,  obtaining a spectral sparsifier of arbitrary precision. Sampling from the sketch requires a novel application of \${\textbackslash}ell\_2/{\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ sparse recovery, a natural extension of the \${\textbackslash}ell\_0\$ methods used for cut sparsifiers in [K. J. Ahn, S. Guha, and A. McGregor, in Proceedings of the 31st ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, 2012, pp. 5--14]. Recent work on row sampling for matrix approximation gives a recursive approach for obtaining the required coarse sparsifiers [G. L. Miller and R. Peng,  ŭlhttp://arXiv.org/abs/1211.2713v1, 2012]. Under certain restrictions, our approach also extends to the problem of maintaining a spectral approximation for a general matrix \$A{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}top A\$ given a stream of updates to rows in \$A\$.},

In reality, such data may be very difficult or expensive to obtain. For example, it may require the time and expertise of cardiologists, space launch technicians, or other domain specialists. As in many other domains, there are often copious amounts of unlabeled data available. For example, the PhysioBank archive contains gigabytes of ECG data. In this work we propose a semi-supervised technique for building time series classifiers. While such algorithms are well known in text domains, we will show that special considerations must be made to make them both efficient and effective for the time series domain. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments on diverse data sources including electrocardiograms, handwritten documents, and video datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach requires only a handful of labeled examples to construct accurate classifiers.},

This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks.

	url = {http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/82349},
	abstract = {The ever-increasing growth of modern networks comes with a paradigm shift in network operation. Networks can no longer be abstracted as deterministic, centrally controlled systems with static topologies but need to be understood as highly distributed, dynamic systems with inherent unreliabilities. This makes many communication, coordination and computation tasks challenging and in many scenarios communication becomes a crucial bottleneck. In this thesis, we develop new algorithms and techniques to address these challenges. In particular we concentrate on broadcast and information dissemination tasks and introduce novel ideas on how randomization can lead to powerful, simple and practical communication primitives suitable for these modern networks. In this endeavor we combine and further develop tools from different disciplines trying to simultaneously addresses the distributed, information theoretic and algorithmic aspects of network communication. The two main probabilistic techniques developed to disseminate information in a network are gossip and random linear network coding. Gossip is an alternative to classical flooding approaches: Instead of nodes repeatedly forwarding information to all their neighbors, gossiping nodes forward information only to a small number of (random) neighbors. We show that, when done right, gossip disperses information almost as quickly as flooding, albeit with a drastically reduced communication overhead. Random linear network coding (RLNC) applies when a large amount of information or many messages are to be disseminated. Instead of routing messages through intermediate nodes, that is, following a classical store-and-forward approach, RLNC mixes messages together by forwarding random linear combinations of messages. The simplicity and topology-obliviousness of this approach makes RLNC particularly interesting for the distributed settings considered in this thesis. Unfortunately the performance of RLNC was not well understood even for the simplest such settings. We introduce a simple yet powerful analysis technique that allows us to prove optimal performance guarantees for all settings considered in the literature and many more that were not analyzable so far. Specifically, we give many new results for RLNC gossip algorithms, RLNC algorithms for dynamic networks, and RLNC with correlated data. We also provide a novel highly efficient distributed implementation of RLNC that achieves these performance guarantees while buffering only a minimal amount of information at intermediate nodes. We then apply our techniques to improve communication primitives in multi-hop radio networks. While radio networks inherently support broadcast communications, e.g., from one node to all surrounding nodes, interference of simultaneous transmissions makes multihop broadcast communication an interesting challenge. We show that, again, randomization holds the key for obtaining simple, efficient and distributed information dissemination protocols. In particular, using random back-off strategies to coordinate access to the shared medium leads to optimal gossip-like communications and applying RLNC achieves the first throughput-optimal multi-message communication primitives. Lastly we apply our probabilistic approach for analyzing simple, distributed propagation protocols in a broader context by studying algorithms for the Lovász Local Lemma. These algorithms find solutions to certain local constraint satisfaction problems by randomly fixing and propagating violations locally. Our two main results show that, firstly, there are also efficient deterministic propagation strategies achieving the same and, secondly, using the random fixing strategy has the advantage of producing not just an arbitrary solution but an approximately uniformly random one. Both results lead to simple, constructions for a many locally consistent structures of interest that were not known to be efficiently constructable before.},

	abstract = {We investigate the properties of the Hybrid Monte-Carlo algorithm (HMC) in high dimensions. HMC develops a Markov chain reversible w.r.t. a given target distribution \${\textbackslash}Pi\$ by using separable Hamiltonian dynamics with potential \$-{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}Pi\$. The additional momentum variables are chosen at random from the Boltzmann distribution and the continuous-time Hamiltonian dynamics are then discretised using the leapfrog scheme. The induced bias is removed via a Metropolis-Hastings accept/reject rule. In the simplified scenario of independent, identically distributed components, we prove that, to obtain an \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(1)\$ acceptance probability as the dimension \$d\$ of the state space tends to \${\textbackslash}infty\$, the leapfrog step-size \$h\$ should be scaled as \$h= l {\textbackslash}times d{\textasciicircum}\{-1/4\}\$. Therefore, in high dimensions, HMC requires \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(d{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\})\$ steps to traverse the state space. We also identify analytically the asymptotically optimal acceptance probability, which turns out to be 0.651 (to three decimal places). This is the choice which optimally balances the cost of generating a proposal, which \{{\textbackslash}em decreases\} as \$l\$ increases, against the cost related to the average number of proposals required to obtain acceptance, which \{{\textbackslash}em increases\} as \$l\$ increases.},

Zeros are a fundamental aspect of systems and control theory; however, the causes and effects of zeros are more subtle than those of poles. In particular, positive zeros can cause initial undershoot (initial error growth), zero crossings, and overshoot in the step response of a system, whereas nonminimum-phase zeros limit bandwidth. Both of these aspects have real-world implications in many applications. Nonminimum-phase zeros exacerbate the tradeoff between the robustness and achievable performance of a feedback control system. From a control-theoretic point of view, a nonminimum-phase zero in the loop transfer function L is arguably the worst feature a system can possess. Every feedback synthesis methodology must accept limitations due to the presence of open-right-half-plane zeros, and the mark of a good analysis tool is the ability to capture the performance limitations arising from nonminimum-phase zeros.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the topological properties of wireless communication maps and their usability in algorithmic design. We consider the SINR model, which compares the received power of a signal at a receiver against the sum of strengths of other interfering signals plus background noise. To describe the behavior of a multi-station network, we use the convenient representation of a {\textbackslash}emph\{reception map\}. In the SINR model, the resulting {\textbackslash}emph\{SINR diagram\} partitions the plane into reception zones, one per station, and the complementary region of the plane where no station can be heard. We consider the general case where transmission energies are arbitrary (or non-uniform). Under that setting, the reception zones are not necessarily convex or even connected. This poses the algorithmic challenge of designing efficient point location techniques as well as the theoretical challenge of understanding the geometry of SINR diagrams. We achieve several results in both directions. We establish a form of weaker convexity in the case where stations are aligned on a line. In addition, one of our key results concerns the behavior of a \$(d+1)\$-dimensional map. Specifically, although the \$d\$-dimensional map might be highly fractured, drawing the map in one dimension higher "heals" the zones, which become connected. In addition, as a step toward establishing a weaker form of convexity for the \$d\$-dimensional map, we study the interference function and show that it satisfies the maximum principle. Finally, we turn to consider algorithmic applications, and propose a new variant of approximate point location.},

This article facilitates the use of these compensators by providing explicit formulas that relate the parameters of the compensators to features of their frequency responses. Two examples illustrate the utility of these compensators for system modeling and controller design. While the examples involve low-order plants, the principles of employing the complex lead and lag compensators remain the same for higher-order systems. We plan to use these compensators as weighting functions with automated robust design tools. A weighting function is a transfer function whose frequency response magnitude is used to bound closed-loop response or modeling uncertainty. The complex lead and lag compensators provide new degree of freedom for selecting weighting functions. In particular, the steep magnitude slope in the transition region of these compensators more closely approximates an ideal step function than weighting functions appearing in the literature (Packard et al.)},

This question is answered in the literature, where it is shown that there does exist a universally good three-block implementation. We then turned to the second question, asking whether there exists a universally good implementation that has fewer than three controller blocks. We considered a broad collection of one- and two-block implementations and determined that none of them are good implementations. Consequently, none of the implementations that we considered are universally good. The final question asks whether, for a given plant and control law u = Crr - Cyy, there necessarily exists a good implementation that has fewer than three blocks. Again, based on the example (9)-(12), we conjecture that the answer is no. The overall conclusion of the article is therefore a conjecture, namely, that it is not only sufficient, but sometimes necessary, to use three controller blocks in a good implementation of u = Crr - Cyy},

	abstract = {The first part of the dissertation investigates the application of the theory of large random matrices to high-dimensional inference problems when the samples are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. A longstanding problem in sensor array processing is addressed by designing an estimator for the number of signals in white noise that dramatically outperforms that proposed by Wax and Kailath. This methodology is extended to develop new parametric techniques for testing and estimation. Unlike techniques found in the literature, these exhibit robustness to high-dimensionality, sample size constraints and eigenvector misspecification. By interpreting the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix as an interacting particle system, the existence of a phase transition phenomenon in the largest ("signal") eigenvalue is derived using heuristic arguments. This exposes a fundamental limit on the identifiability of low-level signals due to sample size constraints when using the sample eigenvalues alone. The analysis is extended to address a problem in sensor array processing, posed by Baggeroer and Cox, on the distribution of the outputs of the Capon-MVDR beamformer when the sample covariance matrix is diagonally loaded.},

	abstract = {For a long time, detection and parameter estimation methods for signal processing have relied on asymptotic statistics as the number n of observations of a population grows large comparatively to the population size N, i.e., n/N → ∞. Modern technological and societal advances now demand the study of sometimes extremely large populations and simultaneously require fast signal processing due to accelerated system dynamics. This results in not-so-large practical ratios n/N, sometimes even smaller than one. A disruptive change in classical signal processing methods has therefore been initiated in the past ten years, mostly spurred by the field of large-dimensional random matrix theory. The early works in random matrix theory for signal processing applications are, however, scarce and highly technical. This tutorial provides an accessible methodological introduction to the modern tools of random matrix theory and to the signal processing methods derived from them, with an emphasis on simple illustrative examples.},

We provide results for SISO systems that illustrate the limits of integral control in achieving setpoint tracking. Although the results in this article are confined to the case of SISO transfer functions, extensions to the MIMO case based on state-space models are of interest. In particular, a MIMO treatment of the problem of command following in the presence of actuator offset is given in (Davison and Smith, 1971). For the case of actuator and sensor disturbances that are both measured, setpoint tracking using feedforward control is considered in (Davison, 1973). Consequently, our results on actuator offset are a special case of (Davison and Smith, 1971), whereas our results on sensor bias are not addressed by (Davison, 1973) due to the additional assumption in (Davison, 1973) of measured offsets},

Applying ideas found in numerical analysis literature, it is shown that, for design purposes, knowledge ofV{\textasciicircum}ast,RRe{\textasciicircum}astis not sufficient: certain subspaces ofV{\textasciicircum}ast,RRe{\textasciicircum}astmay be useless with respect to true design applications.

	abstract = {This work presents a new perspective on characterizing the similarity between elements of a database or, more generally, nodes of a weighted and undirected graph. It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc.) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connecting those elements increases and when the "length" of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel matrix (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph is introduced for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors in a manner that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the Euclidean commute-time distance. This graph PCA provides a nice interpretation to the "Fiedler vector," widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called "statistical relational learning" framework, could also be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a relational database},

	abstract = {The principal concern of the thesis is to understand and uncover interaction-related effects-termed, interactional effects-that arise from the interaction of systems. We may describe the common situation of interest as small entities of systems coming together, interacting, and producing as an aggregate a behavior that would not have occurred without interaction. Those situations are fundamental and appear in countless settings, particularly in settings exhibiting cascade-like intuition. The goal of the research is to show that one can extract from a system the potential it has to generate such effects, and use those extracts to reconstruct, or characterize, the phenomena that emerge upon interaction. In technical terms, we expose cascade-like effects as a loss of exactness, and reveal them as (co)homological intuition waiting to be formalized. We propose a means to relate properties of an interconnected system to its separate component systems in the presence of cascade-like effects. Building on a theory of interconnection reminiscent of the behavioral approach to systems theory, we introduce the notion of generativity, and its byproduct, generative effects. Cascade effects are seen as instances of generative effects. The latter are precisely the instances where properties of interest are not preserved or behave very badly when systems interact. The work overcomes that obstruction. We show how to extract algebraic objects (e.g., vectors spaces) from the systems, that encode their generativity: their potential to generate new phenomena upon interaction. Those objects may then be used to link the properties of the interconnected system to its separate systems. Such a link will be executed through the use of exact sequences from commutative algebra.},

	abstract = {The wavelet transform has become a useful computational tool for a variety of signal and image processing applications. For example, the wavelet transform is useful for the compression of digital image files; smaller files are important for storing images using less memory and for transmitting images faster and more reliably. The FBI uses wavelet transforms for compressing digitally scanned fingerprint images. NASA’s Mars Rovers used wavelet transforms for compressing images acquired by their 18 cameras. The wavelet-based algorithm implemented in software onboard the Mars Rovers is designed to meet the special requirements of deep-space communication. In addition, JPEG2K (the newer JPEG image file format) is based on wavelet transforms. Wavelet transforms are also useful for ‘cleaning’ signals and images (reducing unwanted noise and blurring). Some algorithms for processing astronomical images, for example, are based on wavelet and wavelet-like transforms. This Quick Study describes the wavelet transform, illustrates why it is effective for noise reduction, and briefly describes several improvements of the basic wavelet transform and basic noise reduction method used in the illustration. We describe what the wavelet transform is, and we describe algorithms for processing a signal after its wavelet transform has been computed. First we should point out that there are two basic types of wavelet transform. One type of wavelet transform is designed to be easily reversible (invertible); that means the original signal can be easily recovered after it has been transformed. This kind of wavelet transform is used for image compression and cleaning (noise and blur reduction). Typically, the wavelet transform of the image is first computed, the wavelet representation is then modified appropriately, and then the wavelet transform is reversed (inverted) to obtain a new image. The second type of wavelet transform is designed for signal analysis; for example, to detect faults in machinery from sensor measurements, to study EEG or other biomedical signals, to determine how the frequency content of a signal evolves over time. In these cases, a modified form of the original signal is not needed and the wavelet transform need not be inverted (it can be done in principle, but requires a lot of computation time in comparison with the first type of wavelet transform). In this Quick Study we will focus on those wavelet transforms that are easily invertible. The most basic wavelet transform is the Haar transform described by Alfred Haar in 1910. It serves as the prototypical wavelet transform. We will describe the (discrete) Haar transform, as it},

Physical and behavioral traits of the speaker create a unique spectral signature, and demand for the technology is now skyrocketing.

Stability theory, especially Lyapunov theory is primarily a theory of systems described by first-order differential equations, by flows on manifolds. It is possible to develop a Lyapunov theory which makes it necessary to go through a state space representation. The theory of quadratic Lyapunov differential equations is based on two-variable polynomials. Two-variable polynomials, derivative polynomials, and Lyapunov functions are considered.

	abstract = {Information divergence that measures the difference between two nonnegative matrices or tensors has found its use in a variety of machine learning problems. Examples are Nonnegative Matrix/Tensor Factorization, Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, topic models, and Bayesian network optimization. The success of such a learning task depends heavily on a suitable divergence. A large variety of divergences have been suggested and analyzed, but very few results are available for an objective choice of the optimal divergence for a given task. Here we present a framework that facilitates automatic selection of the best divergence among a given family, based on standard maximum likelihood estimation. We first propose an approximated Tweedie distribution for the β-divergence family. Selecting the best β then becomes a machine learning problem solved by maximum likelihood. Next, we reformulate α-divergence in terms of β-divergence, which enables automatic selection of α by maximum likelihood with reuse of the learning principle for β-divergence. Furthermore, we show the connections between γ- and β-divergences as well as Renyi- and α-divergences, such that our automatic selection framework is extended to non-separable divergences. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can quite accurately select information divergence across different learning problems and various divergence families.},

In this model, each node updates its local variable with a weighted average of its neighbors’ values, and each new value is corrupted by an additive noise with zero mean. The quality of consensus can be measured by the total mean-square deviation of the individual variables from their average, which converges to a steady-state value. We consider the problem of finding the (symmetric) edge weights that result in the least mean-square deviation in steady state. We show that this problem can be cast as a convex optimization problem, so the global solution can be found efficiently. We describe some computational methods for solving this problem, and compare the weights and the mean-square deviations obtained by this method and several other weight design methods.},

Our analysis for first-order systems is facilitated by connections between first-order stochastic consensus and the global mean first passage time of random walks. We then show how to apply similar techniques to analyze second-order stochastic consensus systems. Our analysis reveals that two networks with the same fractal dimension can exhibit different asymptotic scalings for network coherence. Thus, this topological characterization of the network does not uniquely determine coherence behavior. The question of whether the performance of stochastic consensus algorithms in large networks can be captured by purely topological measures, such as the spatial dimension, remains open.},

	abstract = {This is a survey paper in which we explore the connection between graph representations and dissimilarity measures from an information-theoretic perspective. Firstly, we pose graph comparison (or indexing) in terms of entropic manifold alignment. In this regard, graphs are encoded by multi-dimensional point clouds resulting from their embedding. Once these point clouds are aligned, we explore several dissimilarity measures: multi-dimensional statistical tests (such as the Henze-Penrose Divergence and the Total Variation k-dP Divergence), the Symmetrized Normalized Entropy Square variation (SNESV) and Mutual Information. Most of the latter divergences rely on multi-dimensional entropy estimators. Secondly, we address the representation of graphs in terms of populations of tensors resulting from characterizing topological multi-scale subgraphs in terms of covariances of informative spectral features. Such covariances are mapped to a proper tangent space and then considered zero-mean Gaussian distributions. Therefore each graph can be encoded by a linear combination of Gaussians where the coefficients of the combination rely on unbiased geodesics. Distributional graph representations allows us to exploit a large family of dissimilarities used in information theory. We will focus on Bregman divergences (particularly Total Bregman Divergences) based on the Jensen-Shannon and Jensen-Rényi divergences. This latter approach is referred to as tensor-based distributional comparison for distributions can be also estimated from embeddings through Gaussian mixtures.},

The main result is the Graph Representation Theorem stating that a graph is a point in some geometric space, called orbit space. This result shows that the max-operation transforms the feature space to a quotient by a group action. Orbit spaces are well investigated and easier to explore than the original graph space.

	abstract = {In this paper, we make use of the relationship between the Laplace–Beltrami operator and the graph Laplacian, for the purposes of embedding a graph onto a Riemannian manifold. To embark on this study, we review some of the basics of Riemannian geometry and explain the relationship between the Laplace–Beltrami operator and the graph Laplacian. Using the properties of Jacobi fields, we show how to compute an edge-weight matrix in which the elements reflect the sectional curvatures associated with the geodesic paths on the manifold between nodes. For the particular case of a constant sectional curvature surface, we use the Kruskal coordinates to compute edge weights that are proportional to the geodesic distance between points. We use the resulting edge-weight matrix to embed the nodes of the graph onto a Riemannian manifold. To do this, we develop a method that can be used to perform double centring on the Laplacian matrix computed from the edge-weights. The embedding coordinates are given by the eigenvectors of the centred Laplacian. With the set of embedding coordinates at hand, a number of graph manipulation tasks can be performed. In this paper, we are primarily interested in graph-matching. We recast the graph-matching problem as that of aligning pairs of manifolds subject to a geometric transformation. We show that this transformation is Pro-crustean in nature. We illustrate the utility of the method on image matching using the COIL database.},

Accordingly, a wide repertoire of pattern recognition tools, such as classifiers and knowledge discovery procedures, are nowadays available and tested for various datasets of labeled graphs. However, the design of effective learning procedures operating in the space of labeled graphs is still a challenging problem, especially from the computational complexity viewpoint. In this paper, we present a major improvement of a general-purpose classifier for graphs, which is conceived on an interplay between dissimilarity representation, clustering, information-theoretic techniques, and evolutionary optimization algorithms. The improvement focuses on a specific key subroutine devised to compress the input data. We prove different theorems which are fundamental to the setting of the parameters controlling such a compression operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting classifier by benchmarking the developed variants on well-known datasets of labeled graphs, considering as distinct performance indicators the classification accuracy, computing time, and parsimony in terms of structural complexity of the synthesized classification models. The results show state-of-the-art standards in terms of test set accuracy and a considerable speed-up for what concerns the computing time.},

They exhibit, however, a major drawback with regards to the processing tools that are available in their domain. Graph embedding into vector spaces is a growing field among the structural pattern recognition community which aims at providing a feature vector representation for every graph, and thus enables classical statistical learning machinery to be used on graph-based input patterns. In this work, we propose a novel embedding methodology for graphs with continuous node attributes and unattributed edges. The approach presented in this paper is based on statistics of the node labels and the edges between them, based on their similarity to a set of representatives. We specifically deal with an important issue of this methodology, namely, the selection of a suitable set of representatives. In an experimental evaluation, we empirically show the advantages of this novel approach in the context of different classification problems using several databases of graphs.},

	abstract = {The eigendecomposition of an adjacency matrix provides a way to embed a graph as points in finite dimensional Euclidean space. 
This embedding allows the full arsenal of statistical and machine learning methodology for multivariate Euclidean data to be deployed for graph inference.
Our work analyzes this embedding, a graph version of principal component analysis, in the context of various random graph models with a focus on the impact for subsequent inference.
For the stochastic blockmodel, with a finite number of blocks of stochastically equivalent vertices, Sussman, et al (2012), 
Fishkind, et al (2013) and Lyzinski, et al (2013) show that clustering the embedded points using k-means accurately partitions the vertices into the correct blocks, even when the embedding dimension is misspecified or the number of blocks is unknown.
For the more general random dot product graph model, an example of a latent position model, Sussman, et al (2013) shows that the latent positions are consistently estimated by the embedding which then allows for accurate learning in a supervised vertex classification framework. Tang, et al (2012) strengthens these results to more general latent position models.
Athreya, et al (2013) provide distributional results, akin to a central limit theorem, for the residuals between the estimated and true latent positions which provides the potential for deeper understanding of these methods.
In summary, these papers demonstrate that for a broad class of graph models and inference tasks, adjacency-spectral embedding allows for accurate graph inference via standard multivariate methodology.},

In order to overcome the under-determinacy of the problem at hand, we leverage concepts from spectral graph theory and convex optimization to unveil the underlying network structure. More precisely, we formulate the network inference problem as a convex optimization that seeks to endow the network with certain desired properties -- such as sparsity -- while being consistent with the spectral information extracted from the observed opinions. This is complemented with theoretical results proving consistency as the number \$M\$ of topics grows large. We further illustrate our method by numerical experiments, which showcase the effectiveness of the technique in recovering synthetic and real-world networks.},

Although our eigenfunctions satisfy neither the Dirichlet nor the Neumann boundary condition, computing our eigenfunctions via the integral operator is simple and has a potential to utilize modern fast algorithms to accelerate the computation. We also show that our method is better suited for small sample data than the Karhunen–Loève transform/principal component analysis. In fact, our eigenfunctions depend only on the shape of the domain, not the statistics of the data. As a further application, we demonstrate the use of our Laplacian eigenfunctions for solving the heat equation on a complicated domain.},

We use diffusion as a smoothing and scaling tool to enable coarse graining and multiscale analysis. Given a diffusion operator T on a manifold or a graph, with large powers of low rank, we present a general multiresolution construction for efficiently computing, representing and compressing Tt. This allows a direct multiscale computation, to high precision, of functions of the operator, notably the associated Green's function, in compressed form, and their fast application. Classes of operators for which these computations are fast include certain diffusion-like operators, in any dimension, on manifolds, graphs, and in non-homogeneous media. We use ideas related to the Fast Multipole Methods and to the wavelet analysis of Calderón–Zygmund and pseudo-differential operators, to numerically enforce the emergence of a natural hierarchical coarse graining of a manifold, graph or data set. For example for a body of text documents the construction leads to a directory structure at different levels of generalization. The dyadic powers of an operator can be used to induce a multiresolution analysis, as in classical Littlewood–Paley and wavelet theory: we construct, with efficient and stable algorithms, bases of orthonormal scaling functions and wavelets associated to this multiresolution analysis, together with the corresponding downsampling operators, and use them to compress the corresponding powers of the operator. While most of our discussion deals with symmetric operators and relates to localization to spectral bands, the symmetry of the operators and their spectral theory need not be considered, as the main assumption is reduction of the numerical ranks as we take powers of the operator.},

	abstract = {CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Due to its occurrence in engineering domains and implications for natural learning, the problem of utilizing unlabeled data is attracting increasing attention in machine learning. A large body of recent literature has focussed on the transductive setting where labels of unlabeled examples are estimated by learning a function defined only over the point cloud data. In a truly semi-supervised setting however, a learning machine has access to labeled and unlabeled examples and must make predictions on data points never encountered before. In this paper, we show how to turn transductive and standard supervised learning algorithms into semi-supervised learners. We construct a family of data-dependent norms on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). These norms allow us to warp the structure of the RKHS to reflect the underlying geometry of the data. We derive explicit formulas for the corresponding new kernels. Our approach demonstrates state of the art performance on a variety of classification tasks. 1.},

The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.},

We introduce an algorithm that determines the orientability of the intrinsic manifold given a sufficiently large number of sampled data points. If the manifold is orientable, then our algorithm also provides an alternative procedure for computing the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian that are important in the diffusion map framework for reducing the dimensionality of the data. If the manifold is non-orientable, then we provide a modified diffusion mapping of its orientable double covering.},

Recently, there has been significant interest in a class of ranking algorithms based on the assumption that data is sampled from a low dimensional manifold embedded in a higher dimensional Euclidean space. In this paper, we study a popular graph Laplacian based ranking algorithm [23] using an analytical method, which provides theoretical insights into the ranking algorithm going beyond the intuitive idea of "diffusion." Our analysis shows that the algorithm is sensitive to a commonly used parameter due to the use of symmetric normalized graph Laplacian. We also show that the ranking function may diverge to infinity at the query point in the limit of infinite samples. To address these issues, we propose an improved ranking algorithm on manifolds using Green's function of an iterated unnormalized graph Laplacian, which is more robust and density adaptive, as well as pointwise continuous in the limit of infinite samples. We also for the first time in the ranking literature empirically explore two variants from a family of twice normalized graph Laplacians. Experimental results on text and image data support our analysis, which also suggest the potential value of twice normalized graph Laplacians in practice.},

Geometrically, the proposed algorithms can be interpreted as hidden basis recovery by means of function optimization. We give a complete characterization of the contrast functions admissible for provable basis recovery. We show how these conditions can be interpreted as a "hidden convexity" of our optimization problem on the sphere; interestingly, we use efficient convex maximization rather than the more common convex minimization. We also show encouraging experimental results on real and simulated data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we generalize the eigendecomposition of quadratic forms (symmetric matrices) to a broad class of "orthogonally decomposable" functions. We focus on extending two characterizations of eigenvectors: First, that the eigenvectors of a quadratic form arise from the optima structure of the quadratic form on the sphere, and second that the eigenvectors are the fixed points of the matrix power iteration. We identify a key role of convexity in extending these characterizations to our setting. The generalized power iteration is a simple first order method which we call gradient iteration. Further, our framework captures as special cases recent methods for inferential problems in machine learning in areas including orthogonal tensor decompositions, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), topic modeling, spectral clustering, and Gaussian mixture learning. We provide a complete theoretical analysis of gradient iteration using the structure theory of discrete dynamical systems to show almost sure convergence and fast (super-linear) convergence rates. The analysis extends to the case when the observed function is only approximately orthogonally decomposable, with bounds that are polynomial in dimension and other relevant parameters, such as perturbation size. Our perturbation results can be considered as a non-linear version of the classical Davis-Kahan theorem for perturbations of eigenvectors of symmetric matrices.},

Therefore, it is natural to study matrix approximation problems with respect to Bregman divergences. This article proposes a framework for studying these problems, discusses some specific matrix nearness problems, and provides algorithms for solving them numerically.

We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

To date, little work has been done to investigate the tradeoff between computational resources and the quality of learned representations. We present both theoretical and experimental explorations of this question. In particular, we consider Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings based on a kernel matrix, and explore how the embeddings behave when this kernel matrix is corrupted by occlusion and noise. Our main theoretical result shows that under modest noise and occlusion assumptions, we can (with high probability) recover a good approximation to the Laplacian eigenmaps embedding based on the uncorrupted kernel matrix. Our results also show how regularization can aid this approximation. Experimentally, we explore the effects of noise and occlusion on Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings of two real-world data sets, one from speech processing and one from neuroscience, as well as a synthetic data set.},

In this survey paper, we describe a comprehensive paradigm for statistical inference on random dot product graphs, a paradigm centered on spectral embeddings of adjacency and Laplacian matrices. We examine the analogues, in graph inference, of several canonical tenets of classical Euclidean inference: in particular, we summarize a body of existing results on the consistency and asymptotic normality of the adjacency and Laplacian spectral embeddings, and the role these spectral embeddings can play in the construction of single- and multi-sample hypothesis tests for graph data. We investigate several real-world applications, including community detection and classification in large social networks and the determination of functional and biologically relevant network properties from an exploratory data analysis of the Drosophila connectome. We outline requisite background and current open problems in spectral graph inference.},

We show that the entropy of a directed graph is identical to its guessing number and can be bounded from below with the number of vertices minus the size of the graph's shortest index code. We show that the Network Coding solvability of each specific multiple unicast network is completely determined by the entropy (as well as by the shortest index code) of the directed graph that occur by identifying each source node with each corresponding target node. Shannon's information inequalities can be used to calculate upper bounds on a graph's entropy as well as calculating the size of the minimal index code. Recently, a number of new families of so-called non-shannon-type information inequalities have been discovered. It has been shown that there exist communication networks with a capacity strictly less than required for solvability, but where this fact cannot be derived using Shannon's classical information inequalities. Based on this result we show that there exist graphs with an entropy that cannot be calculated using only Shannon's classical information inequalities, and show that better estimate can be obtained by use of certain non-shannon-type information inequalities.},

This framework is able to describe ensembles of undirected, directed as well as weighted networks. These networks might have not trivial community structure or, in the case of networks embedded in a given space, non trivial distance dependence of the link probability. These ensembles are characterized by their entropy which evaluate the cardinality of networks in the ensemble. The general framework we present in this paper is able to describe microcanonical ensemble of networks as well as canonical or hidden variables network ensemble with significant implication for the formulation of network constructing algorithms. Moreover in the paper we define and and characterize in particular the "structural entropy", i.e. the entropy of the ensembles of undirected uncorrelated simple networks with given degree sequence. We discuss the apparent paradox that scale-free degree distribution are characterized by having small structural entropy but are so widely encountered in natural, social and technological complex systems. We give the proof that while scale-free networks ensembles have small structural entropy, they also correspond to the most likely degree distribution with the corresponding value of the structural entropy.},

Therefore, our main contribution is to shed light on the relatedness between some selected information measures for graphs by performing a large scale analysis using chemical networks. Starting from several sets containing real and synthetic chemical structures represented by graphs, we study the relatedness between a classical (partition-based) complexity measure called the topological information content of a graph and some others inferred by a different paradigm leading to partition-independent measures. Moreover, we evaluate the uniqueness of network complexity measures numerically. Generally, a high uniqueness is an important and desirable property when designing novel topological descriptors having the potential to be applied to large chemical databases.},

	abstract = {Subgraph pattern matching is fundamental to graph analytics and has wide applications. Unfortunately, high computational complexity limits the robustness guarantees of existing algorithms: they do not scale for modern large graph datasets and/or they have limitations in terms of accuracy or in terms of the intricacy of the patterns supported. We present algorithms, theory, and empirical evidence that iteratively eliminating vertices that do not meet local constraints dramatically reduces the search space for pattern matching in real-world graphs, and demonstrate a scalable implementation of our algorithms. We additionally identify the characteristics of patterns for which every non-eliminated vertex participates in a match. These techniques are an essential step to enable scalable, practical solutions for robust pattern matching in large-scale labeled graphs.We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach through strong and weak scaling experiments on massive-scale real-world (up to 257 billion edges) and synthetic (up to 2.2 trillion edges) graphs and at scales (256 compute nodes with 6,144 processors) orders of magnitude larger than those used in the past for similar problems.},

	abstract = {The principal concern of the thesis is to understand and uncover interaction-related effects-termed, interactional effects-that arise from the interaction of systems. We may describe the common situation of interest as small entities of systems coming together, interacting, and producing as an aggregate a behavior that would not have occurred without interaction. Those situations are fundamental and appear in countless settings, particularly in settings exhibiting cascade-like intuition. The goal of the research is to show that one can extract from a system the potential it has to generate such effects, and use those extracts to reconstruct, or characterize, the phenomena that emerge upon interaction. In technical terms, we expose cascade-like effects as a loss of exactness, and reveal them as (co)homological intuition waiting to be formalized. We propose a means to relate properties of an interconnected system to its separate component systems in the presence of cascade-like effects. Building on a theory of interconnection reminiscent of the behavioral approach to systems theory, we introduce the notion of generativity, and its byproduct, generative effects. Cascade effects are seen as instances of generative effects. The latter are precisely the instances where properties of interest are not preserved or behave very badly when systems interact. The work overcomes that obstruction. We show how to extract algebraic objects (e.g., vectors spaces) from the systems, that encode their generativity: their potential to generate new phenomena upon interaction. Those objects may then be used to link the properties of the interconnected system to its separate systems. Such a link will be executed through the use of exact sequences from commutative algebra.},

This feature is known as community structure and encodes precious information about the organization and the function of the nodes. Many algorithms have been proposed but it is not yet clear how they should be tested. Recently we have proposed a general class of undirected and unweighted benchmark graphs, with heterogenous distributions of node degree and community size. An increasing attention has been recently devoted to develop algorithms able to consider the direction and the weight of the links, which require suitable benchmark graphs for testing. In this paper we extend the basic ideas behind our previous benchmark to generate directed and weighted networks with built-in community structure. We also consider the possibility that nodes belong to more communities, a feature occurring in real systems, like, e. g., social networks. As a practical application, we show how modularity optimization performs on our new benchmark.},

Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement, and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. This paper reviews the motivation, development, use, and implications of the UT.},

Two interesting new features emerge through this approach: solvability conditions valid for both regular and singular problems, and an LMI-based parametrization of all H∞-suboptimal controllers, including reduced-order controllers. The solvability conditions involve Riccati inequalities rather than the usual indefinite Riccati equations. Alternatively, these conditions can be expressed as a system of three LMI's. Efficient convex optimization techniques are available to solve this system. Moreover, its solutions parametrize the set of H1 controllers and bear important connections with the controller order and the closed-loop Lyapunov functions. Thanks to such connections, the LMI-based characterization of H1 controllers opens new perspectives for the refinement of H1 design.

To realize simultaneous estimation of states and unknown inputs for positive systems, a special type of unknown input observer (UIO) called positive unknown input observer (PUIO) is introduced and an LMI-based design approach is provided to make its design possible.

	abstract = {Let \$G=({\textbackslash}cV\_G,{\textbackslash}cE\_G)\$ be a network consisting of \$n\$ agents such that \$k {\textless} n\$ of the agents are malicious agents and let \$H=({\textbackslash}cV\_H,{\textbackslash}cE\_H)\$ be a subgraph within \$G\$ consisting of agents equipped with detection filters to identify intrusions by malicious agents. Assume that \$G\$ is also under attack from an external adversary whose goal is to disconnect the largest set of vertices in \$H\$ by sabotaging \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ fraction of its edge set, leaving the detection filters unable to sense intrusions from malicious agents. This paper establishes the algebraic and combinatorial conditions under which \$H\$ is maximally robust to attacks from external adversaries. It is shown that the combinatorial problem of extracting a robust topology for \$H\$ can be formulated as an optimization problem involving the Laplacian spectrum of \$G\$. An algorithm is given to recover the desired topology and its worst case approximation error analysis provided. Two design procedures are given for \$H\$ with the property that after an \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ fraction of the edges are adversarially removed, the network still maintains a connected component that spans at least \$(1-{\textbackslash}frac\{{\textbackslash}epsilon\}\{2{\textbackslash}phi\})\$ fraction of the vertices, with \${\textbackslash}phi\$ denoting the conductance of \$G\$. For the class of similar graphs that are cospectral, we also relate the algebraic connectivity to the third moment of the adjacency matrix of \$G\$, paving the way for an alternative means of obtaining \$H\$ instead of the spectral approach.},

Tensors have a rich history, stretching over almost a century, and touching upon numerous disciplines; but they have only recently become ubiquitous in signal and data analytics at the confluence of signal processing, statistics, data mining and machine learning. This overview article aims to provide a good starting point for researchers and practitioners interested in learning about and working with tensors. As such, it focuses on fundamentals and motivation (using various application examples), aiming to strike an appropriate balance of breadth \{{\textbackslash}em and depth\} that will enable someone having taken first graduate courses in matrix algebra and probability to get started doing research and/or developing tensor algorithms and software. Some background in applied optimization is useful but not strictly required. The material covered includes tensor rank and rank decomposition; basic tensor factorization models and their relationships and properties (including fairly good coverage of identifiability); broad coverage of algorithms ranging from alternating optimization to stochastic gradient; statistical performance analysis; and applications ranging from source separation to collaborative filtering, mixture and topic modeling, classification, and multilinear subspace learning.},

	url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00553838/document},
	abstract = {Future cognitive radio networks are expected to come as a disruptive technological advance in the currently saturated field of wireless communications. The idea behind cognitive radios is to think of the wireless channels as a pool of communication resources, which can be accessed on-demand by a primary licensed network or opportunistically preempted (or overlaid) by a secondary network with lower access priority. From a physical layer point of view, the primary network is ideally oblivious of the existence of a co-localized secondary networks. The latter are therefore required to autonomously explore the air in search for resource left-overs, and then to optimally exploit the available resource. The exploration and exploitation procedures, which involve multiple interacting agents, are requested to be highly reliable, fast and efficient. The objective of the present report is to model, analyse and propose computationally efficient and close-to-optimal solutions to the above operations. Precisely, for the exploration phase, we first resort to the maximum entropy principle to derive communication models with many unknowns, from which we derive the optimal multi-source multi-sensor Neyman-Pearson signal sensing procedure. The latter allows for a secondary network to detect the presence of spectral left-overs. The computational complexity of the optimal approach however calls for simpler techniques, which are recollected and discussed. We then proceed to the extension of the signal sensing approach to the more advanced blind user localization, which provides further valuable information to overlay occupied spectral resources. In the last of the main chapters, we move to the study of the exploitation phase, that is, of the optimal sharing of available resources. To this end, we derive an (asymptotically accurate) approximated expression for the uplink ergodic sum rate of a multi-antenna multiple-access channel and propose solutions for cognitive radios to adapt rapidly to the evolution of the primary network at a minimum feedback cost for the secondary networks. The mathematical tools and algorithms derived throughout this work unfold from recent advances in random matrix theory, and especially from the field of large dimensional random matrices with independent entries. A thorough introduction of the main concepts along with new results required for a full understanding of the present report are also provided.},

To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images.},

Our analysis for first-order systems is facilitated by connections between first-order stochastic consensus and the global mean first passage time of random walks. We then show how to apply similar techniques to analyze second-order stochastic consensus systems. Our analysis reveals that two networks with the same fractal dimension can exhibit different asymptotic scalings for network coherence. Thus, this topological characterization of the network does not uniquely determine coherence behavior. The question of whether the performance of stochastic consensus algorithms in large networks can be captured by purely topological measures, such as the spatial dimension, remains open.},

Thus, we define a new class of consensus dynamics, which can be exploited in certain applications such as pose estimation in capacity and memory constrained sensor networks. For consensus networks over finite fields, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the network topology and weights to ensure convergence. We show that consensus networks over finite fields converge in finite time, a feature that can be hardly achieved over the field of real numbers. For the design of finite-field consensus networks, we propose a general design method, with high computational complexity, and a network composition rule to generate large consensus networks from smaller components. Finally, we discuss the application of finite-field consensus networks to distributed averaging and pose estimation in sensor networks.},

The primary aim of its well-known authors is to provide a solid and relevant base of mathematical skills - the skills needed to solve complex problems, to evaluate horrendous sums, and to discover subtle patterns in data. It is an indispensable text and reference not only for computer scientists - the authors themselves rely heavily on it! - but for serious users of mathematics in virtually every discipline. Concrete Mathematics is a blending of CONtinuous and disCRETE mathematics. "More concretely," the authors explain, "it is the controlled manipulation of mathematical formulas, using a collection of techniques for solving problems." The subject matter is primarily an expansion of the Mathematical Preliminaries section in Knuth's classic Art of Computer Programming, but the style of presentation is more leisurely, and individual topics are covered more deeply. Several new topics have been added, and the most significant ideas have been traced to their historical roots. The book includes more than 500 exercises, divided into six categories. Complete answers are provided for all exercises, except research problems, making the book particularly valuable for self-study. Major topics include:  Sums Recurrences Integer functions Elementary number theory Binomial coefficients Generating functions Discrete probability Asymptotic methods  This second edition includes important new material about mechanical summation. In response to the widespread use of the first edition as a reference book, the bibliography and index have also been expanded, and additional nontrivial improvements can be found on almost every page. Readers will appreciate the informal style of Concrete Mathematics. Particularly enjoyable are the marginal graffiti contributed by students who have taken courses based on this material.

	abstract = {The “classical” random graph models, in particular G(n,p), are “homogeneous,” in the sense that the degrees (for example) tend to be concentrated around a typical value. Many graphs arising in the real world do not have this property, having, for example, power-law degree distributions. Thus there has been a lot of recent interest in defining and studying “inhomogeneous” random graph models. One of the most studied properties of these new models is their “robustness”, or, equivalently, the “phase transition” as an edge density parameter is varied. For G(n,p), p = c/n, the phase transition at c = 1 has been a central topic in the study of random graphs for well over 40 years. Many of the new inhomogeneous models are rather complicated; although there are exceptions, in most cases precise questions such as determining exactly the critical point of the phase transition are approachable only when there is independence between the edges. Fortunately, some models studied have this property already, and others can be approximated by models with independence. Here we introduce a very general model of an inhomogeneous random graph with (conditional) independence between the edges, which scales so that the number of edges is linear in the number of vertices. This scaling corresponds to the p = c/n scaling for G(n,p) used to study the phase transition; also, it seems to be a property of many large real-world graphs. Our model includes as special cases many models previously studied. We show that, under one very weak assumption (that the expected number of edges is “what it should be”), many properties of the model can be determined, in particular the critical point of the phase transition, and the size of the giant component above the transition. We do this by relating our random graphs to branching processes, which are much easier to analyze. We also consider other properties of the model, showing, for example, that when there is a giant component, it is “stable”: for a typical random graph, no matter how we add or delete o(n) edges, the size of the giant component does not change by more than o(n). © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For a given art gallery, represented by a polygon, the AGP seeks for the minimum number of guards that are necessary for overseeing the entire polygon. Many variants of this problems have already been studied. In this paper, we are interested in examining and visualizing two algorithms for the distributed version of the AGP, where guards are autonomous and have limited communication abilities. For this purpose, we present a self-contained simulator that is able to read or generate non convex polygons and to simulate the movements of robotic guards inside the polygonal environment by using the navigation algorithms. In particular, we study two algorithms: Random Search (RS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). We compare RS and DFS, in terms of computation time, by testing them on benchmark instances as well as randomly generated polygons. According to our experiments, each algorithm has a better performance on specific types of polygons.},

Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions.

	abstract = {We study optimal contracting between a firm selling a divisible good that exhibits positive externality and a group of agents in a social network. The extent of externality that each agent receives from the consumption of neighboring agents is privately held and is unknown to the firm. By explicitly characterizing the optimal contract when the utilities are quadratic, we demonstrate how inefficiency in one agent’s trade propagates through the network and creates unequal, downward distortion in other agents’ trades. We further characterize the effect of propagation of the distortion on the firm’s profit in terms of agents’ influence and centrality in the network. We identify influential agents whose inefficiencies incur maximum loss on the firm’s profit. By explicitly solving for the simpler yet suboptimal bilateral contracts, we characterize the optimality gap between these and multilateral contracts in terms of the underlying network structure. When the network is balanced in the sense of homogeneity of influences, we show that the network structure will have no impact on the firm’s profit when contracts are bilateral. On the other hand, when the influences are heterogeneous and have high dispersion (as in star-like networks) we show that the restriction to bilateral contract can result in profit losses that grow unboundedly with the size of the network. Our result highlights the role of influential agents and network structure in design of optimal contracts and determines when knowledge of the network structure is beneficial to the firm.},

	abstract = {Many important real-world decision-making problems involve interactions of individuals with purely informational externalities, for example, in jury deliberations, expert committees, etc. We model such interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based on that information while also observing other people's beliefs or actions. As a Bayesian agent attempts to infer the truth from her sequence of observations of actions of others and her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief on the signals that other players could have observed and actions that they could have taken given that other players are also rational. The existing literature addresses asymptotic properties of Bayesian group decisions (important questions such as convergence to consensus and learning). In this work, we address the computations that the Bayesian agent should undertake to realize the optimal actions at every decision epoch. We use the iterated eliminations of infeasible signals (IEIS) to model the thinking process as well as the calculations of a Bayesian agent in a group decision scenario. We show that IEIS algorithm runs in exponential time; however, when the group structure is a partially ordered set the Bayesian calculations simplify and polynomial-time computation of the Bayesian recommendations is possible. We next shift attention to the case where agents reveal their beliefs (instead of actions) at every decision epoch. We analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is NP-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency.},

	url = {http://www.nber.org/papers/w20369},
	abstract = {We examine the interplay between social norms and the enforcement of laws. Agents choose a behavior (e.g., tax evasion, production of low-quality products, corruption, substance abuse, etc.) and then are randomly matched with another agent. An agent's payoff decreases with the mismatch between her behavior and her partner's, as well as average behavior in society. A law is an upper bound (cap) on behavior and a law-breaker, when detected, pays a fine and has her behavior forced down to the level of the law. Law-breaking depends on social norms because detection relies, at least in part, on private cooperation and whistle-blowing. Law-abiding agents have an incentive to whistle-blow because this reduces the mismatch with their partner's behavior as well as the overall negative externality. When laws are in conflict with norms so that many agents are breaking the law, each agent anticipates little whistle-blowing and is more likely to also break the law. Tighter laws (banning more behaviors) have counteracting effects, reducing behavior among law-abiding individuals but inducing more law-breaking. Greater fines for law breaking and better public enforcement reduce the number of law-breakers and behavior among law-abiding agents, but increase levels of law breaking among law-breakers (who effectively choose their behavior targeting other high-behavior law-breakers). Within a dynamic version of the model, we show that laws that are in strong conflict with prevailing social norms may backfire, while gradual tightening of laws can be more effective by changing social norms.},

For instance some nodes can belong to many layers and few communities while others can belong to few layers but many communities. Moreover the multilink communities can be formed by a different number of relevant layers.

This information can be extracted by measuring the correlations present in the multiplex networks structure, such as the overlap of the links in different layers. Many multiplex networks are also weighted, and the weights of the links can be strongly correlated with the structural properties of the multiplex network. For example in multiplex network formed by the citation and collaboration networks between PRE scientists it was found that the statistical properties of citations to co-authors are different from the one of citations to non-co-authors, i.e. the weights depend on the overlap of the links. Here we present a theoretical framework for modelling multiplex weighted networks with different types of correlations between weights and overlap. To this end, we use the framework of canonical network ensembles, and the recently introduced concept of multilinks, showing that null models of a large variety of network structures can be constructed in this way.

In these networks, relevant information might not be captured if the single layers were analyzed separately. Here we demonstrate that such partial analysis of layers fails to capture significant correlations between weights and topology of complex multiplex networks. To this end, we study two weighted multiplex co-authorship and citation networks involving the authors included in the American Physical Society. We show that in these networks weights are strongly correlated with multiplex structure, and provide empirical evidence in favor of the advantage of studying weighted measures of multiplex networks, such as multistrength and the inverse multiparticipation ratio.

Many of these multiplex are characterized by a significant overlap of the links in different layers. In this paper we introduce a statistical mechanics framework to describe multiplex ensembles. A multiplex is a system formed by N nodes and M layers of interactions where each node belongs to the M layers at the same time. Each layer \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ is formed by a network \$G{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$. Here we introduce the concept of correlated multiplex ensembles in which the existence of a link in one layer is correlated with the existence of a link in another layer. This implies that a typical multiplex of the ensemble can have a significant overlap of the links in the different layers. Moreover we characterize microcanonical and canonical multiplex ensembles satisfying respectively hard and soft constraints and we discuss how to construct multiplex in these ensembles. Finally we provide the expression for the entropy of these ensembles that can be useful to address different inference problems involving multiplexes.},

We first introduce the embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods, random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their performance against one another and versus non-embedding based models. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some potential applications and future directions. We finally present the open-source Python library, named GEM (Graph Embedding Methods), we developed that provides all presented algorithms within a unified interface, to foster and facilitate research on the topic.},

For example, despite intensive investigations over half a century, the neuronal implementation of local motion detection in the insect visual system remains elusive. Here, we developed a semi-automated pipeline using electron microscopy to reconstruct a connectome, containing 379 neurons and 8,637 chemical synaptic contacts, within the Drosophila optic medulla. By matching reconstructed neurons to examples from light microscopy, we assigned neurons to cell types and assembled a connectome of the medulla's repeating module. Within this module, we identified cell types constituting a motion detection circuit and showed that the connections onto individual motion-sensitive neurons in this circuit were consistent with their direction selectivity. Our results identify cellular targets for future functional investigations, and demonstrate that connectomes can provide key insights into neuronal computations.},

	abstract = {Feature extraction and dimension reduction for networks is critical in a wide variety of domains. Efficiently and accurately learning features for multiple graphs has important applications in statistical inference on graphs. We propose a method to jointly embed multiple undirected graphs. Given a set of graphs, the joint embedding method identifies a linear subspace spanned by rank one symmetric matrices and projects adjacency matrices of graphs into this subspace. The projection coefficients can be treated as features of the graphs. We also propose a random graph model which generalizes classical random graph model and can be used to model multiple graphs. We show through theory and numerical experiments that under the model, the joint embedding method produces estimates of parameters with small errors. Via simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the joint embedding method produces features which lead to state of the art performance in classifying graphs. Applying the joint embedding method to human brain graphs, we find it extract interpretable features that can be used to predict individual composite creativity index.},

In this model, nodes are represented as random vectors on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$, and the probability of an edge between nodes \$i\$ and \$j\$ is given by the bilinear form \$X\_i{\textasciicircum}T I\_\{p,q\} X\_j\$, where \$I\_\{p,q\} = {\textbackslash}mathrm\{diag\}(1,{\textbackslash}ldots, 1, -1, {\textbackslash}ldots, -1)\$ with \$p\$ ones and \$q\$ minus ones, where \$p+q=d\$. As we show, this provides the only possible representation of nodes in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ such that mixed membership is encoded as the corresponding convex combination of latent positions. The positions are identifiable only up to transformation in the indefinite orthogonal group \$O(p,q)\$, and we discuss some consequences for typical follow-on inference tasks, such as clustering and prediction.},

However, training models at scale over large data sets remains a daunting challenge. One such problem is the detection of overlapping communities within graphs. For example, a social network can be modeled as a graph where the vertices and edges represent individuals and their relationships. As opposed to the problem of graph partitioning or clustering, an individual can be part of multiple communities which significantly increases the problem complexity. In this paper, we present and evaluate an efficient parallel and distributed implementation of a Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that solves the overlapping community detection problem. We show that the algorithm can scale and process graphs consisting of billions of edges and tens of millions of vertices on a compute cluster of 65 nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of deducing overlapping communities has been learned for problems of such a large scale.},

An algebraic approach for computing vertex separators is considered in this paper. It is, shown that lower bounds on separator sizes can be obtained in terms of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix associated with a graph. The Laplacian eigenvectors of grid graphs can be computed from Kronecker products involving the eigenvectors of path graphs, and these eigenvectors can be used to compute good separators in grid graphs. A heuristic algorithm is designed to compute a vertex separator in a general graph by first computing an edge separator in the graph from an eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix, and then using a maximum matching in a subgraph to compute the vertex separator. Results on the quality of the separators computed by the spectral algorithm are presented, and these are compared with separators obtained from other algorithms for computing separators. Finally, the time required to compute the Laplacian eigenvector is reported, and the accuracy with which the eigenvector must be computed to obtain good separators is considered. The spectral algorithm has the advantage that it can be implemented on a medium-size multiprocessor in a straightforward manner.},

	abstract = {Networks or graphs can easily represent a diverse set of data sources that are characterized by interacting units or actors. Social networks, representing people who communicate with each other, are one example. Communities or clusters of highly connected actors form an essential feature in the structure of several empirical networks. Spectral clustering is a popular and computationally feasible method to discover these communities. The stochastic blockmodel [Social Networks 5 (1983) 109--137] is a social network model with well-defined communities; each node is a member of one community. For a network generated from the Stochastic Blockmodel, we bound the number of nodes "misclustered" by spectral clustering. The asymptotic results in this paper are the first clustering results that allow the number of clusters in the model to grow with the number of nodes, hence the name high-dimensional. In order to study spectral clustering under the stochastic blockmodel, we first show that under the more general latent space model, the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian asymptotically converge to the eigenvectors of a "population" normalized graph Laplacian. Aside from the implication for spectral clustering, this provides insight into a graph visualization technique. Our method of studying the eigenvectors of random matrices is original.},

However, it predicts a Poisson degree distribution within each community, while most real-world networks have a heavy-tailed degree distribution. The degree-corrected block model can accommodate arbitrary degree distributions within communities. But since it takes the vertex degrees as parameters rather than generating them, it cannot use them to help it classify the vertices, and its natural generalization to directed graphs cannot even use the orientations of the edges. In this paper, we present variants of the block model with the best of both worlds: they can use vertex degrees and edge orientations in the classification process, while tolerating heavy-tailed degree distributions within communities. We show that for some networks, including synthetic networks and networks of word adjacencies in English text, these new block models achieve a higher accuracy than either standard or degree-corrected block models.},

The transition separates a regime in which such methods successfully detect the community structure from one in which the structure is present but is not detected. By comparing these results with recent analyses of maximum-likelihood methods, we are able to show that spectral modularity maximization is an optimal detection method in the sense that no other method will succeed in the regime where the modularity method fails.},

	abstract = {Multilayer networks allow one to represent diverse and interdependent connectivity patterns --- e.g., time-dependence, multiple subsystems, or both --- that arise in many applications and which are difficult or awkward to incorporate into standard network representations. In the study of multilayer networks, it is important to investigate "mesoscale" (i.e., intermediate-scale) structures, such as dense sets of nodes known as "communities" that are connected sparsely to each other, to discover network features that are not apparent at the microscale or the macroscale. A variety of methods and algorithms are available to identify communities in multilayer networks, but they differ in their definitions and/or assumptions of what constitutes a community, and many scalable algorithms provide approximate solutions with little or no theoretical guarantee on the quality of their approximations. Consequently, it is crucial to develop generative models of networks to use as a common test of community-detection tools. In the present paper, we develop a family of benchmarks for detecting mesoscale structures in multilayer networks by introducing a generative model that can explicitly incorporate dependency structure between layers. Our benchmark provides a standardized set of null models, together with an associated set of principles from which they are derived, for studies of mesoscale structures in multilayer networks. We discuss the parameters and properties of our generative model, and we illustrate its use by comparing a variety of community-detection methods.},

Networks are often characterized by clusters of constituents that interact more closely with each other and have more connections to one another than they do with the rest of the components of the network. However, systematically identifying and studying such community structure in complicated networks is not easy, especially when the network interactions change over time or contain multiple types of connections, as seen in many biological regulatory networks or social networks. Mucha et al. (p. 876) developed a mathematical method to allow detection of communities that may be critical functional units of such networks. Application to real-world tasks—like making sense of the voting record in the U.S. Senate—demonstrated the promise of the method.
Network science is an interdisciplinary endeavor, with methods and applications drawn from across the natural, social, and information sciences. A prominent problem in network science is the algorithmic detection of tightly connected groups of nodes known as communities. We developed a generalized framework of network quality functions that allowed us to study the community structure of arbitrary multislice networks, which are combinations of individual networks coupled through links that connect each node in one network slice to itself in other slices. This framework allows studies of community structure in a general setting encompassing networks that evolve over time, have multiple types of links (multiplexity), and have multiple scales.
A general mathematical method used to identify closely interacting groups can explain the behavior of complicated networks.

These layers may be interdependent in complicated ways, revealing different kinds of structure in the network. In this work we present a generative model, and an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm, which allows us to perform inference tasks such as community detection and link prediction in this setting. Our model assumes overlapping communities that are common between the layers, while allowing these communities to affect each layer in a different way, including arbitrary mixtures of assortative, disassortative, or directed structure. It also gives us a mathematically principled way to define the interdependence between layers, by measuring how much information about one layer helps us predict links in another layer. In particular, this allows us to bundle layers together to compress redundant information and identify small groups of layers which suffice to predict the remaining layers accurately. We illustrate these findings by analyzing synthetic data and two real multilayer networks, one representing social support relationships among villagers in South India and the other representing shared genetic substring material between genes of the malaria parasite.},

One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

In such networks, each relational definition gives rise to a layer. While each layer provides its own set of information, community structure across layers can be collectively utilized to discover and quantify underlying relational patterns between nodes. To concisely extract information from a multilayer network, we propose to identify and combine sets of layers with meaningful similarities in community structure. In this paper, we describe the “strata multilayer stochastic block model” (sMLSBM), a probabilistic model for multilayer community structure. The central extension of the model is that there exist groups of layers, called “strata”, which are defined such that all layers in a given stratum have community structure described by a common stochastic block model (SBM). That is, layers in a stratum exhibit similar node-to-community assignments and SBM probability parameters. Fitting the sMLSBM to a multilayer network provides a joint clustering that yields node-to-community and layer-to-stratum assignments, which cooperatively aid one another during inference. We describe an algorithm for separating layers into their appropriate strata and an inference technique for estimating the SBM parameters for each stratum. We demonstrate our method using synthetic networks and a multilayer network inferred from data collected in the Human Microbiome Project.},

	abstract = {Detecting the time evolution of the community structure of networks is crucial to identify major changes in the internal organization of many complex systems, which may undergo important endogenous or exogenous events. This analysis can be done in two ways: considering each snapshot as an independent community detection problem or taking into account the whole evolution of the network. In the first case, one can apply static methods on the temporal snapshots, which correspond to configurations of the system in short time windows, and match afterward the communities across layers. Alternatively, one can develop dedicated dynamic procedures so that multiple snapshots are simultaneously taken into account while detecting communities, which allows us to keep memory of the flow. To check how well a method of any kind could capture the evolution of communities, suitable benchmarks are needed. Here we propose a model for generating simple dynamic benchmark graphs, based on stochastic block models. In them, the time evolution consists of a periodic oscillation of the system's structure between configurations with built-in community structure. We also propose the extension of quality comparison indices to the dynamic scenario.},

	abstract = {Community structure is one of the most important features of real networks and reveals the internal organization of the nodes. Many algorithms have been proposed but the crucial issue of testing, i.e. the question of how good an algorithm is, with respect to others, is still open. Standard tests include the analysis of simple artificial graphs with a built-in community structure, that the algorithm has to recover. However, the special graphs adopted in actual tests have a structure that does not reflect the real properties of nodes and communities found in real networks. Here we introduce a new class of benchmark graphs, that account for the heterogeneity in the distributions of node degrees and of community sizes. We use this new benchmark to test two popular methods of community detection, modularity optimization and Potts model clustering. The results show that the new benchmark poses a much more severe test to algorithms than standard benchmarks, revealing limits that may not be apparent at a first analysis.},

	abstract = {Community detection in networks has drawn much attention in diverse fields, especially social sciences. Given its significance, there has been a large body of literature with approaches from many fields. Here we present a statistical framework that is representative, extensible, and that yields an estimator with good properties. Our proposed approach considers a stochastic blockmodel based on a logistic regression formulation with node correction terms. We follow a Bayesian approach that explicitly captures the community behavior via prior specification. We further adopt a data augmentation strategy with latent Polya-Gamma variables to obtain posterior samples. We conduct inference based on a principled, canonically mapped centroid estimator that formally addresses label non-identifiability and captures representative community assignments. We demonstrate the proposed model and estimation on real-world as well as simulated benchmark networks and show that the proposed model and estimator are more flexible, representative, and yield smaller error rates when compared to the MAP estimator from classical degree-corrected stochastic blockmodels.},

We find the method to be efficient, scaling easily to networks with a million or more nodes, and we test it on a range of networks, including real-world examples as well as computer-generated benchmarks, for which it successfully identifies known core-periphery structure with low error rate. We also demonstrate that the method is immune to the detectability transition observed in the related community detection problem, which prevents the detection of community structure when that structure is too weak. There is no such transition for core-periphery structure, which is detectable, albeit with some statistical error, no matter how weak it is.},

	abstract = {Multi-layer networks are networks on a set of entities (nodes) with multiple types of relations (edges) among them where each type of relation/interaction is represented as a network layer. As with single layer networks, community detection is an important task in multi-layer networks. A large group of popular community detection methods in networks are based on optimizing a quality function known as the modularity score, which is a measure of presence of modules or communities in networks. Hence a first step in community detection is defining a suitable modularity score that is appropriate for the network in question. Here we introduce several multi-layer network modularity measures under different null models of the network, motivated by empirical observations in networks from a diverse field of applications. In particular we define the multi-layer configuration model, the multi-layer expected degree model and their various modifications as null models for multi-layer networks to derive different modularities. The proposed modularities are grouped into two categories. The first category, which is based on degree corrected multi-layer stochastic block model, has the multi-layer expected degree model as their null model. The second category, which is based on multi-layer extensions of Newman-Girvan modularity, has the multi-layer configuration model as their null model. These measures are then optimized to detect the optimal community assignment of nodes. We compare the effectiveness of the measures in community detection in simulated networks and then apply them to four real networks.},

In addition to computing equilibrium properties of these models, we demonstrate their use in data analysis and statistical inference, giving efficient algorithms for fitting them to observed network data. This allows us, for instance, to estimate the time constants of network evolution or infer community structure from temporal network data using cues embedded both in the probabilities over time that node pairs are connected by edges and in the characteristic dynamics of edge appearance and disappearance. We illustrate our methods with a selection of applications, both to computer-generated test networks and real-world examples.},

We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques.

In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

Even failures of few nodes or links may have a profound impact on large parts of the system. Traditionally, network vulnerability assessment methods separate the studies of node vulnerability and link vulnerability, and thus ignore joint node and link attack schemes that may cause grave damage to the network. To this end, we introduce a new assessment method, called ?-disruptor, that unifies both link and node vulnerability assessment. The new assessment method is formulated as an optimization problem in which we aim to identify a minimum-cost set of mixed links and nodes whose removal would severely disrupt the network connectivity. We prove the NP-completeness of the problem and propose an O(?logn) bicriteria approximation algorithm for the ?-disruptor problem. This new theoretical guarantee improves the best approximation results for both link and node vulnerability assessment in literature. We further enhance the proposed algorithm by embedding it into a special combination of simulated annealing and variable neighborhood search method. The results of our extensive simulation-based experiments on synthetic and real networks show the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed vulnerability assessment methods.},

	abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time, and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such "multilayer" features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize "traditional" network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other, and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts, and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks, and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions, and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks.

	abstract = {The study of complex networks has been historically based on simple graph data models representing relationships between individuals. However, often reality cannot be accurately captured by a flat graph model. This has led to the development of multi-layer networks. These models have the potential of becoming the reference tools in network data analysis, but require the parallel development of specific analysis methods explicitly exploiting the information hidden in-between the layers and the availability of a critical mass of reference data to experiment with the tools and investigate the real-world organization of these complex systems. In this work we introduce a real-world layered network combining different kinds of online and offline relationships, and present an innovative methodology and related analysis tools suggesting the existence of hidden motifs traversing and correlating different representation layers. We also introduce a notion of betweenness centrality for multiple networks. While some preliminary experimental evidence is reported, our hypotheses are still largely unverified, and in our opinion this calls for the availability of new analysis methods but also new reference multi-layer social network data.},

This paper introduces efficient algorithms that do not require such knowledge and yet achieve the optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs identified in [AS15] for linear size communities. The results are three-fold: (i) in the constant degree regime, an algorithm is developed that requires only a lower-bound on the relative sizes of the communities and detects communities with an optimal accuracy scaling for large degrees; (ii) in the regime where degrees are scaled by \${\textbackslash}omega(1)\$ (diverging degrees), this is enhanced into a fully agnostic algorithm that only takes the graph in question and simultaneously learns the model parameters (including the number of communities) and detects communities with accuracy \$1-o(1)\$, with an overall quasi-linear complexity; (iii) in the logarithmic degree regime, an agnostic algorithm is developed that learns the parameters and achieves the optimal CH-limit for exact recovery, in quasi-linear time. These provide the first algorithms affording efficiency, universality and information-theoretic optimality for strong and weak consistency in the general SBM with linear size communities.},

We also obtain that the maximum number of detectable blocks scales as \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\}\$, where \$N\$ is the number of nodes in the network, for a fixed average degree \${\textless}k{\textgreater}\$. We also show that the simplicity of the MDL approach yields an efficient multilevel Monte Carlo inference algorithm with a complexity of \$O({\textbackslash}tau N{\textbackslash}log N)\$, if the number of blocks is unknown, and \$O({\textbackslash}tau N)\$ if it is known, where \${\textbackslash}tau\$ is the mixing time of the Markov chain.

	abstract = {The increasing availability of temporal network data is calling for more research on extracting and characterizing mesoscopic structures in temporal networks and on relating such structure to specific functions or properties of the system. An outstanding challenge is the extension of the results achieved for static networks to time-varying networks, where the topological structure of the system and the temporal activity patterns of its components are intertwined. Here we investigate the use of a latent factor decomposition technique, non-negative tensor factorization, to extract the community-activity structure of temporal networks. The method is intrinsically temporal and allows to simultaneously identify communities and to track their activity over time. We represent the time-varying adjacency matrix of a temporal network as a three-way tensor and approximate this tensor as a sum of terms that can be interpreted as communities of nodes with an associated activity time series. We summarize known computational techniques for tensor decomposition and discuss some quality metrics that can be used to tune the complexity of the factorized representation. We subsequently apply tensor factorization to a temporal network for which a ground truth is available for both the community structure and the temporal activity patterns. The data we use describe the social interactions of students in a school, the associations between students and school classes, and the spatio-temporal trajectories of students over time. We show that non-negative tensor factorization is capable of recovering the class structure with high accuracy. In particular, the extracted tensor components can be validated either as known school classes, or in terms of correlated activity patterns, i.e., of spatial and temporal coincidences that are determined by the known school activity schedule.},

Parameters for the whole network, which is what is of interest, are estimated by applying the model to the sub-network. This assumes that the model is consistent under sampling, or, in terms of the theory of stochastic processes, that it defines a projective family. Focusing on the popular class of exponential random graph models (ERGMs), we show that this apparently trivial condition is in fact violated by many popular and scientifically appealing models, and that satisfying it drastically limits ERGM's expressive power. These results are actually special cases of more general results about exponential families of dependent random variables, which we also prove. Using such results, we offer easily checked conditions for the consistency of maximum likelihood estimation in ERGMs, and discuss some possible constructive responses.},

	abstract = {Significant efforts have gone into the development of statistical models for analyzing data in the form of networks, such as social networks. Most existing work has focused on modeling static networks, which represent either a single time snapshot or an aggregate view over time. There has been recent interest in statistical modeling of dynamic networks, which are observed at multiple points in time and offer a richer representation of many complex phenomena. In this paper, we propose a state-space model for dynamic networks that extends the well-known stochastic blockmodel for static networks to the dynamic setting. We then propose a procedure to fit the model using a modification of the extended Kalman filter augmented with a local search. We apply the procedure to analyze a dynamic social network of email communication.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2380},
	abstract = {In the high dimensional Stochastic Blockmodel for a random network, the number of clusters (or blocks) K grows with the number of nodes N. Two previous studies have examined the statistical estimation performance of spectral clustering and the maximum likelihood estimator under the high dimensional model; neither of these results allow K to grow faster than N{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\}. We study a model where, ignoring log terms, K can grow proportionally to N. Since the number of clusters must be smaller than the number of nodes, no reasonable model allows K to grow faster; thus, our asymptotic results are the "highest" dimensional. To push the asymptotic setting to this extreme, we make additional assumptions that are motivated by empirical observations in physical anthropology (Dunbar, 1992), and an in depth study of massive empirical networks (Leskovec et al 2008). Furthermore, we develop a regularized maximum likelihood estimator that leverages these insights and we prove that, under certain conditions, the proportion of nodes that the regularized estimator misclusters converges to zero. This is the first paper to explicitly introduce and demonstrate the advantages of statistical regularization in a parametric form for network analysis.},

	abstract = {Discovering and characterizing the large-scale topological features in empirical networks are crucial steps in understanding how complex systems function. However, most existing methods used to obtain the modular structure of networks suffer from serious problems, such as being oblivious to the statistical evidence supporting the discovered patterns, which results in the inability to separate actual structure from noise. In addition to this, one also observes a resolution limit on the size of communities, where smaller but well-defined clusters are not detectable when the network becomes large. This phenomenon occurs not only for the very popular approach of modularity optimization, which lacks built-in statistical validation, but also for more principled methods based on statistical inference and model selection, which do incorporate statistical validation in a formally correct way. Here we construct a nested generative model that, through a complete description of the entire network hierarchy at multiple scales, is capable of avoiding this limitation, and enables the detection of modular structure at levels far beyond those possible with current approaches. Even with this increased resolution, the method is based on the principle of parsimony, and is capable of separating signal from noise, and thus will not lead to the identification of spurious modules even on sparse networks. Furthermore, it fully generalizes other approaches in that it is not restricted to purely assortative mixing patterns, directed or undirected graphs, and ad hoc hierarchical structures such as binary trees. Despite its general character, the approach is tractable, and can be combined with advanced techniques of community detection to yield an efficient algorithm that scales well for very large networks.},

Many deterministic and probabilistic clustering methods have been developed to analyze such structures. Given a network, almost all of them partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, according to their connection profile. However, recent studies have shown that these techniques were too restrictive and that most of the existing networks contained overlapping clusters. To tackle this issue, we present in this paper the Overlapping Stochastic Block Model. Our approach allows the vertices to belong to multiple clusters, and, to some extent, generalizes the well-known Stochastic Block Model [Nowicki and Snijders (2001)]. We show that the model is generically identifiable within classes of equivalence and we propose an approximate inference procedure, based on global and local variational techniques. Using toy data sets as well as the French Political Blogosphere network and the transcriptional network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we compare our work with other approaches.},

Spectral partioning using the normalized Laplacian and the adjacency matrix have both been shown to be consistent as the number of vertices tend to infinity. Importantly, both procedures require that the number of blocks and the rank of the communication probability matrix are known, even as the rest of the parameters may be unknown. In this article, we prove that the (suitably modified) adjacency-spectral partitioning procedure, requiring only an upper bound on the rank of the communication probability matrix, is consistent. Indeed, this result demonstrates a robustness to model mis-specification; an overestimate of the rank may impose a moderate performance penalty, but the procedure is still consistent. Furthermore, we extend this procedure to the setting where adjacencies may have multiple modalities and we allow for either directed or undirected graphs.},

Popular approaches, including the stochastic block model, assume edges are unweighted, which limits their utility by throwing away potentially useful information. We introduce the `weighted stochastic block model' (WSBM), which generalizes the stochastic block model to networks with edge weights drawn from any exponential family distribution. This model learns from both the presence and weight of edges, allowing it to discover structure that would otherwise be hidden when weights are discarded or thresholded. We describe a Bayesian variational algorithm for efficiently approximating this model's posterior distribution over latent block structures. We then evaluate the WSBM's performance on both edge-existence and edge-weight prediction tasks for a set of real-world weighted networks. In all cases, the WSBM performs as well or better than the best alternatives on these tasks.},

However, normalization for spectral clustering is commonly believed to be beneficial [Stat. Comput. 17 (2007) 395-416]. Indeed, our experiments show that normalization improves prediction accuracy. In this paper, for the popular stochastic blockmodel, we theoretically show that normalization shrinks the spread of points in a class by a constant fraction under a broad parameter regime.

	abstract = {The planted partition model (also known as the stochastic blockmodel) is a classical cluster-exhibiting random graph model that has been extensively studied in statistics, physics, and computer science. In its simplest form, the planted partition model is a model for random graphs on \$n\$ nodes with two equal-sized clusters, with an between-class edge probability of \$q\$ and a within-class edge probability of \$p\$. Although most of the literature on this model has focused on the case of increasing degrees (ie.{\textbackslash} \$pn, qn {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$ as \$n {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}infty\$), the sparse case \$p, q = O(1/n)\$ is interesting both from a mathematical and an applied point of view. A striking conjecture of Decelle, Krzkala, Moore and Zdeborov{\textbackslash}'a based on deep, non-rigorous ideas from statistical physics gave a precise prediction for the algorithmic threshold of clustering in the sparse planted partition model. In particular, if \$p = a/n\$ and \$q = b/n\$, then Decelle et al.{\textbackslash} conjectured that it is possible to cluster in a way correlated with the true partition if \$(a - b){\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater} 2(a + b)\$, and impossible if \$(a - b){\textasciicircum}2 {\textless} 2(a + b)\$. By comparison, the best-known rigorous result is that of Coja-Oghlan, who showed that clustering is possible if \$(a - b){\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater} C (a + b)\$ for some sufficiently large \$C\$. We prove half of their prediction, showing that it is indeed impossible to cluster if \$(a - b){\textasciicircum}2 {\textless} 2(a + b)\$. Furthermore we show that it is impossible even to estimate the model parameters from the graph when \$(a - b){\textasciicircum}2 {\textless} 2(a + b)\$; on the other hand, we provide a simple and efficient algorithm for estimating \$a\$ and \$b\$ when \$(a - b){\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater} 2(a + b)\$. Following Decelle et al, our work establishes a rigorous connection between the clustering problem, spin-glass models on the Bethe lattice and the so called reconstruction problem.

Our approach offers an intuitive but powerful tool to infer the semantic underpinnings of each actor, such as its social roles or biological functions, underlying the observed network topologies. Our model builds on earlier work on a mixed membership stochastic blockmodel for static networks, and the state-space model for tracking object trajectory. It overcomes a major limitation of many current network inference techniques, which assume that each actor plays a unique and invariant role that accounts for all its interactions with other actors; instead, our method models the role of each actor as a time-evolving mixed membership vector that allows actors to behave differently over time and carry out different roles/functions when interacting with different peers, which is closer to reality. We present an efficient algorithm for approximate inference and learning using our model; and we applied our model to analyze a social network between monks (i.e., the Sampson's network), a dynamic email communication network between the Enron employees, and a rewiring gene interaction network of fruit fly collected during its full life cycle.

The proposed NCV method is based on a block-wise node-pair splitting technique, combined with an integrated step of community recovery using sub-blocks of the adjacency matrix. We prove that the probability of under selection vanishes as the number of node increases, under mild conditions satisfied by a wide range of popular community recovery algorithms.

ML estimators can be computed using the EM algorithm, but this strategy is practical only for small graphs. A Bayesian estimator, based on the Gibbs sampling, is proposed. This estimator is practical also for large graphs. When ML estimators are used, the block structure can be predicted based on predictive likelihood. When Gibbs sampling is used, the block structure can be predicted from posterior predictive probabilities. A side result is that when the number of vertices tends to infinity while the probabilities remain constant, the block structure can be recovered correctly with probability tending to 1.},

All variables and operations are Boolean. This model is motivated by coding, synchronization, and community detection problems. In particular, it corresponds to a stochastic block model or a correlation clustering problem with two communities and censored edges. Without noise, exact recovery of X is possible if and only the graph G is connected, with a sharp threshold at the edge probability log(n)=n for Erdös-Rényi random graphs. The first goal of this paper is to determine how the edge probability p needs to scale to allow exact recovery in the presence of noise. Defining the degree (oversampling) rate of the graph by α = np= log(n), it is shown that exact recovery is possible if and only if α {\textgreater} 2/(1-2ε)2+o(1/(1-2ε)2). In other words, 2/(1-2ε)2 is the information theoretic threshold for exact recovery at low-SNR. In addition, an efficient recovery algorithm based on semidefinite programming is proposed and shown to succeed in the threshold regime up to twice the optimal rate. Full version available in [1].},

In the symmetric case, the graph has two equally sized clusters and vertices connect with probability p within clusters and q across clusters. In the past two decades, a large body of literature in statistics and computer science has focused on providing lower bounds on the scaling of {\textbar} p - q{\textbar} to ensure exact recovery. In this paper, we identify a sharp threshold phenomenon for exact recovery: if α = pn/log(n) and β = qn/ log(n) are constant (with α {\textgreater} β), recovering the communities with high probability is possible if (α + β/2) - √(αβ) {\textgreater} 1 and is impossible if (α + β/2) - √(αβ) {\textless}; 1. In particular, this improves the existing bounds. This also sets a new line of sight for efficient clustering algorithms. While maximum likelihood (ML) achieves the optimal threshold (by definition), it is in the worst case NP-hard. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on a semidefinite programming relaxation of ML, which is proved to succeed in recovering the communities close to the threshold, while numerical experiments suggest that it may achieve the threshold. An efficient algorithm that succeeds all the way down to the threshold is also obtained using a partial recovery algorithm combined with a local improvement procedure.},

A graph G from such a model is generated by first assigning vertex labels at random from a finite alphabet, and then connecting vertices with edge probabilities depending on the labels of the endpoints. In the case of the symmetric two-group model, we establish an explicit `single-letter' characterization of the per-vertex mutual information between the vertex labels and the graph, when the graph average degree diverges. The explicit expression of the mutual information is intimately related to estimation-theoretic quantities, and -in particular- reveals a phase transition at the critical point for community detection. Below the critical point the per-vertex mutual information is asymptotically the same as if edges were independent of the vertex labels. Correspondingly, no algorithm can estimate the partition better than random guessing. Conversely, above the threshold, the per-vertex mutual information is strictly smaller than the independent-edges upper bound. In this regime there exists a procedure that estimates the vertex labels better than random guessing.},

This paper shows that at k = 5, it is possible to cross the KS threshold in the disassortative regime with a non-efficient algorithm that samples a clustering having typical cluster volumes. Further, the gap between the KS and information-theoretic threshold is shown to be large in some cases. In the case where edges are drawn only across clusters with an average degree of b, and denoting by k the number of communities, the KS threshold reads b ≳ k2 whereas our information-theoretic bound reads b ≳ k ln(k).},

We focus on two types of asymptotic recovery guarantees as n → ∞: 1) weak recovery: expected number of classification errors is o(K) and 2) exact recovery: probability of classifying all indices correctly converges to one. Under mild assumptions on P and Q, and allowing the community size to scale sublinearly with n, we derive a set of sufficient conditions and a set of necessary conditions for recovery, which are asymptotically tight with sharp constants. The results hold, in particular, for the Gaussian case, and for the case of bounded log likelihood ratio, including the Bernoulli case whenever (p/q) and (1 - p)/(1 - q) are bounded away from zero and infinity. Previous work has shown that if weak recovery is achievable; then, exact recovery is achievable in linear additional time by a simple voting procedure. We provide a converse, showing the condition for the voting procedure to succeed is almost necessary for exact recovery.},

Synthetic graphs can be generated from the model and will have the structure previously inferred. For this, we use the Stochastic-Block-Model (SBM) and the Degree-Corrected-Block-Model (DCBM), a variant allowing for heavy tailed degree distributions. The models originate in the social sciences and separate a graph into groups of nodes. To show the applicability of the models to the task of synthetic graph generation in the domain of communication networks, we use one router level and one IP-to-IP communication graph. We assert the quality of the generated models by evaluating a number of graph features and comparing our results to those obtained with the network generator Orbis. We find our approach to be on par with, or even outperforming Orbis. Furthermore, the models are able to capture large-scale structure in communication networks.},

	abstract = {Networks have been a general tool for representing, analyzing, and modeling relational data arising in several domains. One of the most important aspect of network analysis is community detection or network clustering. Until recently, the major focus have been on discovering community structure in single (i.e., monoplex) networks. However, with the advent of relational data with multiple modalities, multiplex networks, i.e., networks composed of multiple layers representing different aspects of relations, have emerged. Consequently, community detection in multiplex network, i.e., detecting clusters of nodes shared by all layers, has become a new challenge. In this paper, we propose Network Fusion for Composite Community Extraction (NF-CCE), a new class of algorithms, based on four different non-negative matrix factorization models, capable of extracting composite communities in multiplex networks. Each algorithm works in two steps: first, it finds a non-negative, low-dimensional feature representation of each network layer; then, it fuses the feature representation of layers into a common non-negative, low-dimensional feature representation via collective factorization. The composite clusters are extracted from the common feature representation. We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms over the state-of-the-art methods on various types of multiplex networks, including biological, social, economic, citation, phone communication, and brain multiplex networks.},

These algorithms have been proved to have a better performance on a variety of regular graph analysis tasks, such as link prediction, or multi-label classification.

Here we develop a notion of a temporal network motif as an elementary unit of temporal networks and provide a general methodology for counting such motifs. We define temporal network motifs as induced subgraphs on sequences of temporal edges, design fast algorithms for counting temporal motifs, and prove their runtime complexity. Our fast algorithms achieve up to 56.5x speedup compared to a baseline method. Furthermore, we use our algorithms to count temporal motifs in a variety of networks. Results show that networks from different domains have significantly different motif counts, whereas networks from the same domain tend to have similar motif counts.

	abstract = {A principled approach to characterize the hidden structure of networks is to formulate generative models and then infer their parameters from data. When the desired structure is composed of modules or “communities,” a suitable choice for this task is the stochastic block model (SBM), where nodes are divided into groups, and the placement of edges is conditioned on the group memberships. Here, we present a nonparametric Bayesian method to infer the modular structure of empirical networks, including the number of modules and their hierarchical organization. We focus on a microcanonical variant of the SBM, where the structure is imposed via hard constraints, i.e., the generated networks are not allowed to violate the patterns imposed by the model. We show how this simple model variation allows simultaneously for two important improvements over more traditional inference approaches: (1) deeper Bayesian hierarchies, with noninformative priors replaced by sequences of priors and hyperpriors, which not only remove limitations that seriously degrade the inference on large networks but also reveal structures at multiple scales; (2) a very efficient inference algorithm that scales well not only for networks with a large number of nodes and edges but also with an unlimited number of modules. We show also how this approach can be used to sample modular hierarchies from the posterior distribution, as well as to perform model selection. We discuss and analyze the differences between sampling from the posterior and simply finding the single parameter estimate that maximizes it. Furthermore, we expose a direct equivalence between our microcanonical approach and alternative derivations based on the canonical SBM.},

	abstract = {A principled approach to understand network structures is to formulate generative models. Given a collection of models, however, an outstanding key task is to determine which one provides a more accurate description of the network at hand, discounting statistical fluctuations. This problem can be approached using two principled criteria that at first may seem equivalent: selecting the most plausible model in terms of its posterior probability; or selecting the model with the highest predictive performance in terms of identifying missing links. Here we show that while these two approaches yield consistent results in most of cases, there are also notable instances where they do not, that is, where the most plausible model is not the most predictive. We show that in the latter case the improvement of predictive performance can in fact lead to overfitting both in artificial and empirical settings. Furthermore, we show that, in general, the predictive performance is higher when we average over collections of models that are individually less plausible, than when we consider only the single most plausible model.},

	url = {http://webcat.warwick.ac.uk/record=b2863162~S1},
	abstract = {Recently, there has been a great interest in methods that can decompose brain networks into clusters with similar connection patterns. However, most of the currently used clustering methods in neuroimaging are based on the stringent assumption that the cluster structure is modular, that is, the nodes are densely connected within clusters, but sparsely connected between clusters. Furthermore, multi-subject network data is typically fit by several subject-by-subject analyses, which are limited by the fact that there is no obvious way to combine the results for group comparisons, or on a group-averaged network analysis, which does not reflect the variability between subjects. In the first part of this thesis, we consider the analysis of a single binary-valued brain network using the Stochastic Blockmodel (Daudin et al., 2008) and compare it to the widely used clustering methods, Louvain and Spectral algorithms. For this, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) worm nervous system as a model organism whose wealth of prior biological knowledge can be used to validate the functional relevance of network decompositions. We show that the ‘cores-in-modules’ decomposition of the worm brain network estimated by the Stochastic Blockmodel is more compatible with prior biological knowledge about the C. elegans than the purely modular decompositions found by the Louvain and Spectral algorithms. In the second part of this thesis, we propose three multi-subject extensions of Daudin et al.’s Stochastic Blockmodel that can estimate a common cluster structure across subjects. Two of these (non-trivial) models use subject specific covariates to model variation in connection rates in the data. The first and trivial model assumes no variability between subjects, the second model accounts for a global variability in connections between subjects, and the third model accounts for local variability in connections between subjects that can differ across individual within/between-cluster connectivity elements. In the third part of this thesis, we propose a mixed-effect multi-subject model which can account for the repeated-measures aspects of multi-subject network data by including a random intercept. For the second and third part of the thesis, we use intensive Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the accuracy of the estimated parameters as well as the validity of inference procedures. Furthermore, we illustrate the proposed models on a resting state fMRI dataset with two groups of subjects: healthy volunteers and individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Networks are ubiquitous in science and have become a focal point for discussion in everyday life. Formal statistical models for the analysis of network data have emerged as a major topic of interest in diverse areas of study, and most of these involve a form of graphical representation. Probability models on graphs date back to 1959. Along with empirical studies in social psychology and sociology from the 1960s, these early works generated an active network community and a substantial literature in the 1970s. This effort moved into the statistical literature in the late 1970s and 1980s, and the past decade has seen a burgeoning network literature in statistical physics and computer science. The growth of the World Wide Web and the emergence of online networking communities such as Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn, and a host of more specialized professional network communities has intensified interest in the study of networks and network data. Our goal in this review is to provide the reader with an entry point to this burgeoning literature. We begin with an overview of the historical development of statistical network modeling and then we introduce a number of examples that have been studied in the network literature. Our subsequent discussion focuses on a number of prominent static and dynamic network models and their interconnections. We emphasize formal model descriptions, and pay special attention to the interpretation of parameters and their estimation. We end with a description of some open problems and challenges for machine learning and statistics.},

The simultaneous design of a physical system and its controller is addressed here using a decomposition-based approach. An optimization subproblem is defined for both the physical system (i.e., plant) design and the control system design. The plant subproblem is solved using a general optimization algorithm, while the controls subproblem is solved using a new approach based on optimal control theory. The optimal control solution, which is derived using the the Minimum Principle of Pontryagin (PMP), accounts for coupling between plant and controller design by managing additional variables and penalty terms required for system coordination. Augmented Lagrangian Coordination is used to solve the system design problem, and is demonstrated using a circuit design problem.},

For a single broad-band source, propagating in a pure delay environment and observed with an isotropic array, an accurate indication of the model dimension is derived which is independent on the array configuration, being a function of the observed source time-bandwidth product only. Using these representations, procedures are described for controlling the spatial and spectral response of linearly constrained minimum variance broad-band array/beamformers. The procedures employ linear constraints to control complex gain characteristics, over selected bands of frequency, for multiple points of 3-D regions of source locations and do not require the use of steering delays. The constraints are derived from source representation spaces and are termed eigenvector constraints. Simulations are presented which illustrate the effectiveness of the new linear constraints.},

Various forms of local cell implementation based on efficient time-recursions of time-varying coefficients are discussed.

The first one is to show how several different variants of the recursive least-squares algorithm can be directly related to the widely studied Kalman filtering problem of estimation and control. Our second important goal is to present all the different versions of the RLS algorithm in computationally convenient square-root forms: a prearray of numbers has to be triangularized by a rotation, or a sequence of elementary rotations, in order to yield a postarray of numbers. The quantities needed to form the next prearray can then be read off from the entries of the postarray, and the procedure can be repeated; the explicit forms of the rotation matrices are not needed in most cases.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

As a byproduct, the problem of decomposing a simple polygon into a minimum number of star-shaped polygons such that their union is the original polygon is also shown to be NP-hard.},

As performance criteria, we consider the worst case detection time (WDT) and the average detection time (ADT). We focus on the case of a chain of cameras, and we obtain the following results. First, we characterize a lower bound on the WDT and on the ADT of smart intruders. Second, we propose a team trajectory for the cameras, namely equal-waiting trajectory, with minimum WDT and with guarantees on the ADT. Third, we design a distributed algorithm to coordinate the cameras along an equal-waiting trajectory. Fourth, we design a distributed algorithm for cameras reconfiguration in the case of failure or network change. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms via numerical studies and experiments.},

In many applications, the possibly huge tensors can be approximated well by compact multilinear models or decompositions. Tensor decompositions are more versatile tools than the linear models resulting from traditional matrix approaches. Compared to matrices, tensors have at least one extra dimension. The number of elements in a tensor increases exponentially with the number of dimensions, and so do the computational and memory requirements. The exponential dependency (and the problems that are caused by it) is called the curse of dimensionality. The curse limits the order of the tensors that can be handled. Even for a modest order, tensor problems are often large scale. Large tensors can be handled, and the curse can be alleviated or even removed by using a decomposition that represents the tensor instead of using the tensor itself. However, most decomposition algorithms require full tensors, which renders these algorithms infeasible for many data sets. If a tensor can be represented by a decomposition, this hypothesized structure can be exploited by using compressed sensing (CS) methods working on incomplete tensors, i.e., tensors with only a few known elements.},

	abstract = {The finite Fourier transform is discussed from the viewpoint of finite dimensional algebras over commutative rings. Three main consequences of this approach are developed. First we assume, G to be an arbitrary finite Abelian group of order n and R to be a commutative integral domain. It is shown that the group algebra R[G] is isomorphic to the “pointwise multiplication” algebra Rn if and only if R contains 1/n together with a primitive m-th root of unity, where m is the exponent of G. Matrix representations of the isomorphisms are derived and each is called a generalized finite Fourier transform. The finite Walsh and Hadamard transforms are of course special cases. More important is the result that Fourier transforms may be defined over finite fields of appropriate characteristic. The second development involves the systematic use of tensor products of algebras in order to induce factorization of the fourier trans-form matrix. This results in a general decomposition formula from which all possible versions of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm may be derived. Specifically both the Cooley-Tukey and Good algorithms are induced by a single functional congruence, the solutions to which define all algorithms of the Fast Fourier Transform type.},

Formal statistical models for the analysis of network data have emerged as a major topic of interest in diverse areas of study, and most of these involve a form of graphical representation. Probability models on graphs date back to 1959. Along with empirical studies in social psychology and sociology from the 1960s, these early works generated an active “social science network community” and a substantial literature in the 1970s. This effort moved into the statistical literature in the late 1970s and 1980s, and the past decade has seen a burgeoning network literature coming out of statistical physics and computer science. In particular, the growth of the World Wide Web and the emergence of online “networking communities” such as Facebook, Google+, MySpace, LinkedIn, and Twitter, and a host of more specialized professional network communities have intensified interest in the study of networks and network data. This article reviews some of these developments, introduces some relevant statistical models for static network settings, and briefly points to open challenges.},

This measurement model does not require including the 3D feature position in the state vector of the EKF and is optimal, up to linearization errors. The vision-aided inertial navigation algorithm we propose has computational complexity only linear in the number of features, and is capable of high-precision pose estimation in large-scale real-world environments.

We begin with a short historical tour of Granger causality, concentrating on its closeness to information theory. The definitions of Granger causality based on prediction are recalled, and the importance of the observation set is discussed. We present the definitions based on conditional independence. The notion of instantaneous coupling is included in the definitions. The concept of Granger causality graphs is discussed. We present directed information theory from the perspective of studies of causal influences between stochastic processes. Causal conditioning appears to be the cornerstone for the relation between information theory and Granger causality. In the bivariate case, the fundamental measure is the directed information, which decomposes as the sum of the transfer entropies and a term quantifying instantaneous coupling. We show the decomposition of the mutual information into the sums of the transfer entropies and the instantaneous coupling measure, a relation known for the linear Gaussian case. We study the multivariate case, showing that the useful decomposition is blurred by instantaneous coupling. The links are further developed by studying how measures based on directed information theory naturally emerge from Granger causality inference frameworks as hypothesis testing.},

	abstract = {We make four main contributions to the theory of network formation. (1) The problem of network formation with farsighted agents can be formulated as an abstract network formation game. (2) In any farsighted network formation game the feasible set of networks contains a unique, finite, disjoint collection of nonempty subsets having the property that each subset forms a strategic basin of attraction. These basins of attraction contain all the networks that are likely to emerge and persist if individuals behave farsightedly in playing the network formation game. (3) A von Neumann-Morgenstern stable set of the farsighted network formation game is constructed by selecting one network from each basin of attraction. We refer to any such von Neumann-Morgenstern stable set as a farsighted basis. (4) The core of the farsighted network formation game is constructed by selecting one network from each basin of attraction containing a single network. We call this notion of the core, the farsighted core. We conclude that the farsighted core is nonempty if and only if there exists at least one farsighted basin of attraction containing a single network. To relate our three equilibrium and stability notions (basins of attraction, farsighted basis, and farsighted core) to recent work by Jackson and Wolinsky (1996), we define a notion of pairwise stability similar to the Jackson-Wolinsky notion and we show that the farsighted core is contained in the set of pairwise stable networks. Finally, we introduce, via an example, competitive contracting networks and highlight how the analysis of these networks requires the new features of our network formation model.},

We consider a single-input single-output plant regulated by a control law based on the estimate of a Kalman filter.

The objective of the attacker is to maximize the estimation error of the Kalman filter - which in turn quantifies the degradation of the control performance - by tampering with the control input, while remaining undetected. We introduce a notion of ε-stealthiness to quantify the difficulty to detect an attack when an arbitrary detection algorithm is implemented by the controller. For a desired value of ε-stealthiness, we quantify the largest estimation error that an attacker can induce, and we analytically characterize an optimal attack strategy. Because our bounds are independent of the detection mechanism implemented by the controller, our information-theoretic analysis characterizes fundamental security limitations of stochastic cyber-physical systems.},

This paper is a first attempt to design positive unknown input observers (PUIO) for positive linear systems. The structural constraints on observer parameters make the design task cumbersome. However, with the aid of a positive stabilization scheme via LMI and by imposing conditions on positivity of the generalized inverse associated with a certain design matrix, we provide a reliable procedure for the design of PUIOs.},

	title = {Time-{Varying} {Actuator} {Scheduling} in {Complex} {Networks}},
	abstract = {This paper studies the benefit of time-varying actuator scheduling on the controllability of undirected complex networks with linear dynamics. We define a new notion of nodal communicability, termed 2k-communicability, and unveil the role that this centrality measure plays in selecting which nodes to actuate over time to optimize network controllability, as measured by the trace of the controllability Gramian. We identify various conditions on the network structure that determine whether it benefits or not from time-varying actuator scheduling, and quantify the sub-optimality gap of time-invariant policies. Intuitively, our analysis shows that time-varying actuator policies should be used when the network has multiple heterogeneous central nodes, as measured by 2k-communicability. We illustrate our results with examples of deterministic and random networks. I. INTRODUCTION Many natural and man-made systems, ranging from the nervous system to power and transportation grids and the Internet, exhibit dynamic behaviors that evolve over a sparse and complex interconnection structure. The ability to control network dynamics is not only a theoretically challenging problem but, more importantly, a barrier to fundamental breakthroughs across engineering, social sciences, and neuroscience. While multiple studies have addressed various aspects of this problem, several fundamental questions remain unanswered, including to what extent the capability of actuating a different set of nodes over time can improve controllability of large-scale, time-varying network systems. In this paper we study controllability of networks with fixed topology and weights where, however, the set of control nodes can be selected over time. Intuitively, the ability to actuate different nodes at different times allows for targeted interventions at different network locations, and can ultimately decrease the control effort to accomplish a desired task. Yet, from a practical standpoint, the implementation of time-varying control schemes requires the ability to geographically relocate actuators or the presence of actuation mechanisms at different, possibly all, network nodes, and more sophisticated control policies. To justify the additional implementation costs and control complexity, we seek to characterize network topologies and dynamics that benefit from time-varying actuator schedules, and quantify the associated control improvement. We consider time-varying control policies where a small subset of available actuators is used at any given time. While this may seem at odds with the objective of reducing the overall control effort, this scenario is relevant when, for instance, (i) actuators exhibit nonlinear dead-zone},

Linear programming duality in zero-sum games and the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem are applied to obtain properties that are satisfied in any Nash equilibrium. A characterization of the support of the equilibrium strategies is provided using graph-theoretic arguments. Finally, conditions under which these results extend to budget-constrained environments are also studied.

The problem involves selecting the minimum number of sensors such that every pipe failure can be uniquely localized. This problem can be viewed as a minimum test cover (MTC) problem, which is NP-hard. We consider two approaches to obtain approximate solutions to this problem. In the first approach, we transform the MTC problem to a minimum set cover (MSC) problem and use the greedy algorithm that exploits the submodularity property of the MSC problem to compute the solution to the MTC problem. In the second approach, we develop a new augmented greedy algorithm for solving the MTC problem. This approach does not require the transformation of the MTC to MSC. Our augmented greedy algorithm provides in a significant computational improvement while guaranteeing the same approximation ratio as the first approach. We propose several metrics to evaluate the performance of the sensor placement designs. Finally, we present detailed computational experiments for a number of real water distribution networks.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces combined data integrity and availability attacks to expand the attack scenarios against power system state estimation. The goal of the adversary, who uses the combined attack, is to perturb the state estimates while remaining hidden from the observer. We propose security metrics that quantify vulnerability of power grids to combined data attacks under single and multi-path routing communication models. In order to evaluate the proposed security metrics, we formulate them as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. The relation between the security metrics of combined data attacks and pure data integrity attacks is analyzed, based on which we show that, when data availability and data integrity attacks have the same cost, the two metrics coincide. When data availability attacks have a lower cost than data integrity attacks, we show that a combined data attack could be executed with less attack resources compared to pure data integrity attacks. Furthermore, it is shown that combined data attacks would bypass integrity-focused mitigation schemes. These conclusions are supported by the results obtained on a power system model with and without a communication model with single or multi-path routing.},

Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of distributed fault detection and isolation (FDI) in large networked systems with uncertain system models. The linear networked system is composed of interconnected subsystems and may be represented as a graph. The subsystems are represented by nodes, while the edges correspond to the interconnections between subsystems. Considering faults that may occur on the interconnections and subsystems, as our first contribution, we propose a distributed scheme to jointly detect and isolate faults occurring in nodes and edges of the system. As our second contribution, we analyze the behavior of the proposed scheme under model uncertainties caused by the addition or removal of edges. Additionally, we propose a novel distributed FDI scheme based on local models and measurements that is resilient to changes outside of the local subsystem and achieves FDI. Our third contribution addresses the complexity reduction of the distributed FDI method, by characterizing the minimum amount of model information and measurements needed to achieve FDI and by reducing the number of monitoring nodes. The proposed methods can be fused to design a scalable and resilient distributed FDI architecture that achieves local FDI despite unknown changes outside the local subsystem. The proposed approach is illustrated by numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus power network benchmark.},

The analysis is performed under a variety of assumptions of adversary capability regarding knowledge of details of the VVC algorithm used, system topology, access to actual measurements, and ability to corrupt measurements. The adversary also faces an optimization problem, which is to maximize adverse impact while remaining stealthy. This is achieved by first identifying sets of measurements that can be jointly but stealthily corrupted. Then, the maximal impact of such data corruption is computed for the case where the operator is unaware of the attack and directly applies the configuration from the integrated VVC. Furthermore, since the attacker is constrained to remaining stealthy, we consider a game-theoretic framework where the operator chooses settings to maximize observability and constrain the adversary action space.},

As opposed to other work in the literature, the effect of the adversary's actions on the anomaly detector's output is not constrained to be zero at all times. Moreover, scenarios where the adversary has uncertain model knowledge are also addressed. The set of strategic attack policies is formulated as a non-convex constrained optimization problem, leading to a sensitivity metric denoted as the output-to-output ℓ2-gain. Using the framework of dissipative systems, the output-to-output gain is computed through an equivalent convex optimization problem. Additionally, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the output-to-output gain to be unbounded, with and without model uncertainties, which are tightly related to the invariant zeros of the system.},

Multiple sensors make observations of a process, which are then transmitted, possibly via intermediate sensors, to a central gateway. Transmission over each link can experience packet drops. The time-varying wireless network environment is modelled by the notion of a network state as in Quevedo et al. (2013a). For each network state, different network configurations can be used, which govern the network topology and routing of packets. Switching between different configurations incurs a cost, in that unwanted links will need to be removed before the establishment of new links, leading to a transient time in which some links may not be available. The problem is to determine the optimal network configurations to use in each network state, in order to minimize an expected error covariance measure that takes into account the cost of reconfiguration. A simpler sub-optimal method which minimizes the upper bound of the expected error is also proposed, which in numerical simulations gives essentially identical results to the optimal method.},

To realize simultaneous estimation of states and unknown inputs, we first design positive unknown input observers (PUIO) for positive linear systems, which is the main contribution of this paper. Then, we provide a procedure to estimate the unknown disturbance. The PUIO design can be performed with the aid of a positive stabilization scheme via LMI. A critical step in the design process is the requirement of imposing a condition on positivity of the generalized inverse of a certain design matrix. We show that this can easily be accomplished with the aid of a unique result, which makes the design of PUIO possible. An alternative LMI with less restrictive assumption is also included to design PUIO. Finally, theoretical results are supported by numerical examples.},

In particular, we consider a setup where each node has an initial value and the goal is for (a subset of) the nodes to calculate a function of these values in a distributed manner. We focus on linear iterative strategies for function calculation, where each node updates its value at each time-step to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors; after a sufficiently large number of time-steps, each node is expected to have enough information to calculate the desired function of the initial node values. We study the susceptibility of such strategies to misbehavior by some nodes in the network; specifically, we consider a node to be malicious if it updates its value arbitrarily at each time-step, instead of following the predefined linear iterative strategy. If the connectivity of the network topology is 2f or less, we show that it is possible for a set of f malicious nodes to conspire in a way that makes it impossible for a subset of the other nodes in the network to correctly calculate an arbitrary function of all node values. Our analysis is constructive, in that it provides a specific scheme for the malicious nodes to follow in order to obfuscate the network in this fashion.},

The art gallery problemfor a polygon P is to find a minimum set of points G in P such that every point of P is visible fiom some point of G. This problem has been shown to be NP-hard by Lee and Lin. However, Chvatal showed that the number of points of G will never exceed [n/3] for a simple polygon of n sides. This latter result is referred to as the art gallery theorem. Many variations on the art gallery problem have been studied, and work in this area has accelerated after the publication of the monograph of 0 'Rourke, which deals exclusively with this topic. This paper provides an introduction to art gallery theorems, and surveys the recent results of thefield. The emphasis is on the results rather than the techniques.

	abstract = {In various disciplines, information about the same phenomenon can be acquired from different types of detectors, at different conditions, in multiple experiments or subjects, among others. We use the term “modality” for each such acquisition framework. Due to the rich characteristics of natural phenomena, it is rare that a single modality provides complete knowledge of the phenomenon of interest. The increasing availability of several modalities reporting on the same system introduces new degrees of freedom, which raise questions beyond those related to exploiting each modality separately. As we argue, many of these questions, or “challenges,” are common to multiple domains. This paper deals with two key issues: “why we need data fusion” and “how we perform it.” The first issue is motivated by numerous examples in science and technology, followed by a mathematical framework that showcases some of the benefits that data fusion provides. In order to address the second issue, “diversity” is introduced as a key concept, and a number of data-driven solutions based on matrix and tensor decompositions are discussed, emphasizing how they account for diversity across the data sets. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader, regardless of his or her community of origin, with a taste of the vastness of the field, the prospects, and the opportunities that it holds.},

Our scheme assumes a broadcast model of communication (where all nodes transmit the same value to all of their neighbors) and utilizes a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each node updates its value to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors. We consider a node to be malicious or faulty if, instead of following the predefined linear strategy, it updates its value arbitrarily at each time-step (perhaps conspiring with other malicious nodes in the process). We show that the topology of the network completely characterizes the resilience of linear iterative strategies to this kind of malicious behavior. First, when the network contains 2f or fewer vertex-disjoint paths from some node xj to another node xi , we provide an explicit strategy for f malicious nodes to follow in order to prevent node xi from receiving any information about xj's value. Next, if node xi has at least 2f+1 vertex-disjoint paths from every other (non-neighboring) node, we show that xi is guaranteed to be able to calculate any arbitrary function of all node values when the number of malicious nodes is f or less. Furthermore, we show that this function can be calculated after running the linear iteration for a finite number of time-steps (upper bounded by the number of nodes in the network) with almost any set of weights (i.e., for all weights except for a set of measure zero).},

Our work deals with two types of attacks: attacks on the network nodes and attacks on the communication between the nodes. We propose a distributed scheme to detect and isolate the attacks using observers. Furthermore, we discuss how to reduce the number of observer nodes while maintaining the coverage of the entire network. The results are applied to two classes of networked control systems: a network running the consensus protocol and a power network defined by the linearized swing equation. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the proposed attack detection scheme are provided for the first class of systems. For the second class, we provide a necessary condition for the existence of the proposed detection scheme.},

Two classes of distributed control systems of large practical relevance are considered. It is proved that for these systems, one can construct a bank of unknown input observers, and use them to detect and isolate faults in the network. The result presents a distributed implementation. In particular, by exploiting the system structure, this work provides further insight into the design of \{UIO\} for networked systems. Moreover, the importance of certain network measurements is shown. Infeasibility results with respect to available measurements and faults are also provided, as well as methods to remove faulty agents from the network. Applications to power networks and robotic formations are presented. It is shown how the developed methodology apply to a power network described by the swing equation with a faulty bus. For a multi-robot system, it is illustrated how a faulty robot can be detected and removed.},

We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

In contrast to traditional control and estimation problems, here the observation and control packets may be lost or delayed. The unreliability of the underlying communication network is modeled stochastically by assigning probabilities to the successful transmission of packets. This requires a novel theory which generalizes classical control/estimation paradigms. The paper offers the foundations of such a novel theory. The central contribution is to characterize the impact of the network reliability on the performance of the feedback loop. Specifically, it is shown that for network protocols where successful transmissions of packets is acknowledged at the receiver (e.g., TCP-like protocols), there exists a critical threshold of network reliability (i.e., critical probabilities for the successful delivery of packets), below which the optimal controller fails to stabilize the system. Further, for these protocols, the separation principle holds and the optimal LQG controller is a linear function of the estimated state. In stark contrast, it is shown that when there is no acknowledgment of successful delivery of control packets (e.g., UDP-like protocols), the LQG optimal controller is in general nonlinear. Consequently, the separation principle does not hold in this circumstance},

Specifically we address the question of whether local feedback is sufficient to maintain coherence in large-scale networks subject to stochastic disturbances. We define macroscopic performance measures which are global quantities that capture the notion of coherence; a notion of global order that quantifies how closely the formation resembles a solid object. We consider how these measures scale asymptotically with network size in the topologies of regular lattices in 1, 2, and higher dimensions, with vehicular platoons corresponding to the 1-D case. A common phenomenon appears where a higher spatial dimension implies a more favorable scaling of coherence measures, with a dimensions of 3 being necessary to achieve coherence in consensus and vehicular formations under certain conditions. In particular, we show that it is impossible to have large coherent 1-D vehicular platoons with only local feedback. We analyze these effects in terms of the underlying energetic modes of motion, showing that they take the form of large temporal and spatial scales resulting in an accordion-like motion of formations. A conclusion can be drawn that in low spatial dimensions, local feedback is unable to regulate large-scale disturbances, but it can in higher spatial dimensions. This phenomenon is distinct from, and unrelated to string instability issues which are commonly encountered in control problems for automated highways.},

We first give a Kalman-like simple algebraic criterion for observability in distance regular graphs. This criterion consists in evaluating the rank of a matrix built with the components of the Bose-Mesner algebra associated with the considered graph. Then, we define some bipartite graphs that capture the observability properties of the graph to be studied. In particular, we show that necessary and sufficient observability conditions are given by the nullity of the so-called local bipartite observability graph (respectively, the local unfolded bipartite observability graph) for strongly regular graphs (respectively, the distance regular graphs). When the nullity cannot be derived directly from the structure of these bipartite graphs, the rank of the associated bi-adjacency matrix enables evaluating observability. Eventually, as a byproduct of the main results, we show that nonobservability can be stated just by comparing the valency of the graph to be studied with a bound computed from the number of vertices of the graph and its diameter. Similarly, nonobservability can also be stated by evaluating the size of the maximum matching in the aforementioned bipartite graphs.},

Thus we have proposed a tabu search algorithm to optimize the structural robustness of a given network by rewiring the links and fixing the node degrees. The objective of our algorithm is to maximize a new structural robustness measure, natural connectivity, which provides a sensitive and reliable measure of the structural robustness of complex networks and has lower computation complexity. We initially applied this method to several networks with different degree distributions for contrast analysis and investigated the basic properties of the optimal network. We discovered that the optimal network based on the power-law degree distribution exhibits a roughly “eggplant-like” topology, where there is a cluster of high-degree nodes at the head and other low-degree nodes scattered across the body of “eggplant”. Additionally, the cost to rewire links in practical applications is considered; therefore, we optimized this method by employing the assortative rewiring strategy and validated its efficiency.},

	abstract = {The predominance of recent self-healing power system research has been directed towards centralized command and control functions. In this paper, a decentralized multi-agent control method for distributed microgrids is introduced. Given the complexity of a large power system spanning hundreds of miles and comprised of numerous microgrids, it is potentially unrealistic to expect that centralizing total system control functions is feasible. Therefore, the authors are particularly interested in dispersing decision-making by utilizing smart microgrid control agents that cooperate during normal and emergency situations. The combination of microgrids and agent-based control can improve power system resiliency. The method described herein lays the groundwork for a comprehensive microgrid control architecture that strikes a balance between the multiple intra-microgrid objectives defined by local operator and the situational demands of the microgrid collective as part of the power system. In this way, both self-interest and cooperation can arise, allowing microgrid agents to successfully transition from normal operations to an emergency condition and back again when conditions have resolved, independent of a central supervisor. The decentralized multi-agent methods for microgrids explored in this paper help to support what may be an enabling technology of future smart grids.},

At each phase, every agent only uses local and one-hop neighbors' information to identify and isolate the misbehaving agents, and even compensate their effect on the system. We then extend the proposed algorithm to the leaderless consensus network by introducing and adding two recovery schemes (rollback and excitation recovery) into the current framework to guarantee the accurate convergence of the well-behaving agents in NCS. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through case studies in multirobot formation control and wireless sensor networks.},

We also provide graph-theoretic upper bounds on the controllability and observability indices for structured linear systems (over arbitrary fields). We then use our analysis to design nearest-neighbor rules for multi-agent systems where the state of each agent is constrained to lie in a finite set. We view the discrete states of each agent as elements of a finite field, and employ a linear iterative strategy whereby at each time-step, each agent updates its state to be a linear combination (over the finite field) of its own state and the states of its neighbors. Using our results on structural controllability and observability, we show how a set of leader agents can use this strategy to place all agents into any desired state (within the finite set), and how a set of sink agents can recover the set of initial values held by all of the agents.},

A solution to this problem is relevant for several tasks in multi-agent systems including motion coordination, clock synchronization, and cooperative estimation. In a linear consensus network, we allow for the presence of misbehaving agents, whose behavior deviate from the nominal consensus evolution. We model misbehaviors as unknown and unmeasurable inputs affecting the network, and we cast the misbehavior detection and identification problem into an unknown-input system theoretic framework. We consider two extreme cases of misbehaving agents, namely faulty (non-colluding) and malicious (Byzantine) agents. First, we characterize the set of inputs that allow misbehaving agents to affect the consensus network while remaining undetected and/or unidentified from certain observing agents. Second, we provide worst-case bounds for the number of concurrent faulty or malicious agents that can be detected and identified. Precisely, the consensus network needs to be 2k+1 (resp. k+1) connected for k malicious (resp. faulty) agents to be generially detectable and identifiable by every well behaving agent. Third, we quantify the effect of undetectable inputs on the final consensus value. Fourth, we design three algorithms to detect and identify misbehaving agents. The first and the second algorithm apply fault detection techniques, and affords complete detection and identification if global knowledge of the network is available to each agent, at a high computational cost. The third algorithm is designed to exploit the presence in the network of weakly interconnected subparts, and provides local detection and identification of misbehaving agents whose behavior deviates more than a threshold, which is quantified in terms of the interconnection structure.},

However, attacking single links may not be sufficient to disrupt communications in a network, which may route traffic around jammed links. To date, there has been little research on jamming to disrupt an entire network. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining how to efficiently place jammers to minimize the number of jammers needed to disrupt a network by partitioning it into a specified number of disconnected subnetworks, each of which is limited in size. We formulate this problem as an optimal clustering problem on a graph and show that the clustering problem can be solved exactly as a binary integer linear program (ILP). Since the complexity of the ILP increases rapidly with the size of the network, we also solve the ILP via harmony search, a meta-heuristic algorithm. Harmony search offers the ability to tradeoff between complexity and performance. In the scenarios where comparison between the two algorithms is feasible, the harmony search provides close-to-optimal performance with a much lower time complexity.},

Among other measures, algebraic connectivity has been used to characterize processes such as damped oscillation of liquids in connected pipes. Similar characterizations include the number of edges necessary to disconnect a network: the larger the algebraic connectivity, the larger the number of edges required to disconnect a network and hence, the more robust a network. In this paper, we answer the question, âWhich edge can we rewire to have the largest increase in algebraic connectivity?â. Furthermore, we extend the rewiring of a single edge to rewiring multiple edges to realize the maximal increase in algebraic connectivity. The answer to this question above can provide insights to decision makers within various domains such as communication and transportation networks, who seek an efficient solution to optimize the connectivity and thus increase the robustness of their networks. Most importantly, our analytical and numerical results not only provide insights to the number of edges to rewire, but also the location in the network where these edges would effectuate the maximal increase in algebraic connectivity and therefore, enable a maximal increase in robustness.},

	abstract = {The vast majority of today's critical infrastructure is supported by numerous feedback control loops and an attack on these control loops can have disastrous consequences. This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair (A,C) of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.},

Most of the effort in protecting these cyber-physical systems (CPS) from attacks has been in securing the networks using information security techniques. Effort has also been applied to increasing the protection and reliability of the control system against random hardware and software failures. However, the inability of information security techniques to protect against all intrusions means that the control system must be resilient to various signal attacks for which new analysis methods need to be developed. In this paper, sensor signal attacks are analyzed for observer-based controlled systems. The threat surface for sensor signal attacks is subdivided into denial of service, finite energy, and bounded attacks. In particular, the error signals between states of attack free systems and systems subject to these attacks are quantified. Optimal sensor and actuator signal attacks for the finite and infinite horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control in terms of maximizing the corresponding cost functions are computed. The closed-loop systems under optimal signal attacks are provided. Finally, an illustrative numerical example using a power generation network is provided together with distributed LQ controllers.},

For consensus control, we assume a two stage protocol: an intra-platoon protocol for platoon consensus, and an inter-platoon protocol for global system-wide consensus. The intra-platoon control is based on output information received from agents within the platoon while the inter-platoon control uses only output information of platoon leaders. We show that the system of multi-agent systems arrives at a collective consensus in the sense that each platoon arrives its own platoon consensus and at the same time all platoons collectively achieve global system-wide consensus.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid theoretical framework for robust and resilient control design in which the stochastic switching between structure states models unanticipated events and deterministic uncertainties in each structure represent the known range of disturbances.

A similar approach is proposed for cyber security, where current border-protection designs have been inherited from information technology developments that lack consideration of the high-reliability, high consequence nature of industrial control systems. Instead of an independent development, however, an integrated approach is taken to develop a holistic understanding of performance. This performance takes shape inside a multi-agent design, which provides a notional context to model highly decentralized and complex industrial process control systems, the nervous system of critical infrastructure. The resulting strategy will provide a framework for researching solutions to security and unrecognized interdependency concerns with industrial control systems.},

	doi = {10.1109/ISRCS.2012.6309308},
	abstract = {In an increasingly connected world, critical infrastructure systems suffer from two types of vulnerability. The first is the traditionally recognized problem of monitoring the systems for faults and failures, recognizing and analyzing data, and responding with real understanding to the problems of the system. Increasingly complex systems create the opportunity for single points of failure to cascade when inaccurate assessment of system health increases response time or leads to faulty analysis of the problems involved. A second problem involves vulnerability to cyber intrusion, in which malignant actors can mask system degradation or present false data about system status. A resilient system will protect stability, efficiency, and security. To ensure these three states, the system must react to changing conditions within the system with coordination: no one component of the system can be allowed to react to problems without real consideration of the effects of that action on other components within the system. Systems with multi-agent design typically have three layers of action, a management layer, a coordination layer, and an execution layer. A resilient multi-agent system will emphasize functions of the execution layer, which has the responsibility of initiating actions, monitoring, analyzing, and controlling its own processes, while feeding information back to the higher levels of management and coordination. The design concept of a resilient control system execution agent (ReCoSEA) grows out of these underpinnings, and through the use of computational intelligence techniques, this paper suggests an associated design methodology.},

The research area of demand side management is still very much in flux and several options are being presented which can all be used to manage loads in order to achieve a flexible and more responsive demand. These different control schemes are developed with different organization of the power sector in mind and thus can differ significantly in their architecture, their integration into the various markets, their integration into distribution network operation and several other aspects. This paper proposes a classification of load control policies for demand side management in smart buildings, based on external behavior: direct, indirect, transactional and autonomous control; internal operation: decision support system scope, control strategy, failure handling and architecture.

	abstract = {The increasingly recognized vulnerability of industrial control systems to cyber-attacks has inspired a considerable amount of research into techniques for cyber-resilient control systems. The majority of this effort involves the application of well known information security techniques to protect system networks. These techniques are primarily concerned with the prevention of unauthorized access and the protection of data integrity. While these efforts are important to protect the control systems that operate critical infrastructure, they are never perfectly effective thus motivating a need to develop control systems that will operate successfully during a cyber attack. Little research has focused on the design of control systems with closed-loop dynamics that are resilient to cyber-attack. An understanding of the types of modifications to the system and signals that could be employed by an attacker after they have gained access to the control system and the effects of these attacks on the behavior of the control systems can guide efforts to develop attack detection and mitigation strategies. To formulate this problem, consistent mathematical definitions of concepts within resilient control need to be established to enable a mathematical analysis of the vulnerabilities and resiliencies of a particular control system design methodology and architecture. In this paper, we propose rigorous definitions for state awareness, operational normalcy, and resiliency as they relate to realtime control systems. We will also discuss some mathematical consequences that arise from the proposed definitions.

In this paper, we propose a vulnerability measure, pairwise connectivity, and use it to formulate network vulnerability assessment as a graph-theoretical optimization problem, referred to as -disruptor. The objective is to identify the minimum set of critical network elements, namely nodes and edges, whose removal results in a specific degradation of the network global pairwise connectivity. We prove the NP-completeness and inapproximability of this problem and propose an pseudo-approximation algorithm to computing the set of critical nodes and an pseudo-approximation algorithm for computing the set of critical edges. The results of an extensive simulation-based experiment show the feasibility of our proposed vulnerability assessment framework and the efficiency of the proposed approximation algorithms in comparison to other approaches.},

	title = {Region-based connectivity - a new paradigm for design of fault-tolerant networks},
	doi = {10.1109/HPSR.2009.5307417},
	abstract = {The studies in fault-tolerance in networks mostly focus on the connectivity of the graph as the metric of fault-tolerance. If the underlying graph is k-connected, it can tolerate up to k - 1 failures. In measuring the fault tolerance in terms of connectivity, no assumption regarding the locations of the faulty nodes are made - the failed nodes may be close to each other or far from each other. In other words, the connectivity metric has no way of capturing the notion of locality of faults. However in many networks, faults may be highly localized. This is particularly true in military networks, where an enemy bomb may inflict massive but localized damage to the network. To capture the notion of locality of faults in a network, a new metric region-based connectivity (RBC) was introduced in. It was shown that RBC can achieve the same level of fault-tolerance as the metric connectivity, with much lower networking resources. The study in was restricted to single region fault model (SRFM), where faults are confined to one region only. In this paper, we extend the notion of RBC to multiple region fault model (MRFM), where faults are no longer confined to a single region. As faults in MRFM are still confined to regions, albeit multiple of them, it is different from unconstrained fault model where no constraint on locality of faults is imposed. The MRFM leads to several new concepts, such as region-disjoint paths and region cuts. We show that the classical result, the maximum number of node-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes is equal to the minimum number of nodes whose removal disconnects the pair, is no longer valid when region-disjoint paths and region cuts are considered. We prove that the problems of finding (i) the maximum number of region-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes, and (ii) minimum number of regions whose removal disconnect a pair of nodes, are both NP-complete. We provide heuristic solution to these two problems and evaluate their efficacy by compari- ng the results with optimal solutions.},

	doi = {10.1109/icc.2011.5962427},
	abstract = {Connectivity k(G) of a network G is traditionally considered to be the primary metric for evaluation of its fault tolerance capability. However, connectivity as a metric has several limitations - e.g., it has no mechanism to distinguish between localized and random faults. Also it does not provide any information about the network state, if number of failures exceed k(G). The network state information that might be of interest in such a scenario is the size of the largest connected component. In this paper, we address both these limitations and introduce a new metric called region-based largest component size (RBLCS), that provides the largest size of the component in which the network decomposes once all the nodes of a region fail. We study the computational complexity of finding RBLCS for a given network. In addition, we study the problem of least cost design of a network with a target value of RBLCS. We prove that the optimal design problem is NP-complete and present a heuristic to solve the problem. We evaluate our heuristic by comparing its solutions with the optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our heuristic produces near optimal solution in a fraction of time needed to find the optimal.},

	abstract = {Telecommunications networks, and in particular optical WDM networks, are vulnerable to large-scale failures in their physical infrastructure, resulting from physical attacks (such as an electromagnetic pulse attack) or natural disasters (such as solar flares, earthquakes, and floods). Such events happen at specific geographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network, but their effects cannot be determined exactly in advance. Therefore, we provide a unified framework to model network vulnerability when the event has a probabilistic nature, defined by an arbitrary probability density function. Our framework captures scenarios with a number of simultaneous attacks, when network components consist of several dependent subcomponents, and in which either a 1+1 or a 1:1 protection plan is in place. We use computational geometric tools to provide efficient algorithms to identify vulnerable points within the network under various metrics. Then, we obtain numerical results for specific backbone networks, demonstrating the applicability of our algorithms to real-world scenarios. Our novel approach allows to identify locations that require additional protection efforts (e.g., equipment shielding). Overall, the paper demonstrates that using computational geometric techniques can significantly contribute to our understanding of network resilience.},

In this paper, we focus on detecting critical nodes, or nodes whose deletion results in the minimum pair-wise connectivity among the remaining nodes. This problem, known as the critical node problem has applications in several fields including biomedicine, telecommunications, and military strategic planning. We show that the recognition version of the problem is \{NP\} -complete and derive a mathematical formulation based on integer linear programming. In addition, we propose a heuristic for the problem which exploits the combinatorial structure of the graph. The heuristic is then enhanced by the application of a local improvement method. A computational study is presented in which we apply the integer programming formulation and the heuristic to real and randomly generated data sets. For all instances tested, the heuristic is able to efficiently provide optimal solutions in a fraction of the time required by a commercial software package.},

Graph theoretic, simulation, and optimization-based techniques have played a significant role in examining potential network vulnerabilities given the insights they can provide for mitigating facility loss and prioritizing fortification efforts. Central to these approaches is the concept of facility (arc—node) importance or criticality to system survivability. Assessments of network vulnerability can dramatically differ based on how facility importance is characterized. In this review, various approaches for assessing facility importance and network vulnerability are examined. The key differences in these approaches are the ways in which a facility's role in maintaining network operability is evaluated given arc—node disruption. Comparative results suggest significant differences exist among measures of facility importance and network performance. Furthermore, the subsequent incongruities in these measures and their implications need to be clearly understood to support interdiction risk and vulnerability assessment for critical infrastructures.},

However, most of such works presume perfectly reliable nodes. Although a few studies have considered both link and node failures, none of these methods has utilized the minimal paths or cuts, which are considered as fundamental approaches in the network reliability evaluation. An efficient method for deducing the minimal cutsets of a system subject to both link and node failures from the minimal cutsets of the system, which assumes perfect node reliability, is presented. The proposed method does not require re-enumeration of minimal cutsets for the additional consideration of the node failures. For a simple extension of such a method, the proposed approach can be embedded in any exact or approximate algorithm to account for link failures as well as node failures. As a result, the application of this method would be more realistic and valuable in practice for the reliability evaluation of networks with unreliable nodes.},
